Unfortunately, the bag hadn't made it through Customs yet, so I had already accepted that we may never see the bag again, or at the very best, we would see be lucky enough to get it back days or weeks later. When our flight was slightly delayed, the agent at A76 said she would call the Delta help center, located outside of gate A43, again for us to see if it had cleared Customs.

In 2021 I flew Delta so much that I achieved Platinum Status for 2022. Delta’s Platinum status provides a number of regional upgrades as a reward for flying so much over the course of a year. In July I knew what my travel schedule would be for the remainder of the year so I purchased tickets to travel for September, November and my annual Christmas trip home. I used the certificates to purchase first class seats for my travel dates. Then on the day of my Christmas travel I printed out my first-class tickets and boarding passes for the trip. I reached out to Delta to confirm my seats. At that point I was told that I needed one more pass to have first class seats for my round trip travel. I was told the young lady that I purchased the tickets in June and I have my tickets showing my travel in first class and my seat assignments for the round trip. I was passed along from agent to agent and finally I was told that the agent who booked the trip made a mistake and I would either have to pay $1,100 or 150,000 air miles to use the ticket that I had printed out. I was outraged to say the least. Even though I was told by every agent that I spoke with that it was Delta’s mistake and not mine. Reluctantly, I agreed to their demands and completed my trip however this episode left a really bad taste in my mouth and tarnished my opinion of Delta Airlines. For years I could have been flying US Air and landing in Florence which is closer to my family. However, I remained loyal to Delta because I liked their service.

I had to get back March 5 – and incurred a 1500 dollar expense and major inconvenience to do so, additionally I had to be picked up in Detroit (at 11:30 PM) and driven back to Lansing as the DTW to Lansing flight was missed; I received an email from customer care requesting I submit receipts for costs incurred in Delta cancelling my flight – which I did this AM. They offered to reimburse me 57 dollars. Additionally in communication with the customer care rep I was admonished for emailing and asking to have this escalated to someone who could make a decision on reimbursement. First off, If the costs were not reimbursable then whey did they request I sent receipts in for them in?

"Couple Leisure","Economy Class","02-23","no",1,1,1,1,1,1,1," Original departure time was 10:05am. when I arrived 2 hours early, the plane had too much fuel on board, so after an hour or so they had to send a truck to empty some fuel. the truck they sent was full, so had to wait another hour or so for a new truck to come get some fuel out. We had boarded the plane, by that time, a crew member timed out. We were de-boarded because ""Delta cant have you on the plane for 3 hours (probably because they'd have to refund us at that time) and we were told ""there is another crew member on standby at the lounge. They should be here in about 10 minutes"" - an hour later, still no crew member. By the time the replacement crew member got to us, a pilot had to be replaced due to their time being up as well. Another hour or so later, another plane pulled up to the next gate and we inherited their crew and pilots. Finally boarded again, and after 30 min on the tarmack, were told the plane needed fuel so we were waiting for a fuel truck. An hour later we were waiting on a fuel slip after the truck was done and we were good to depart. Absolutely ridiculous experience. I paid almost $1000 for this trip and specifically chose delta because this experience isn't typical to them. In hindsight, i should have flown another airline. I probably would have had a similar experience with Spirit, but it would have only cost me half of what delta did.  One more addition. My return flight was delayed due to ""mechanical issue"" which was later described in an email from delta as ""damage to the aircraft"" - on that flight customers were offered $800 to switch to a later flight.

The first issue was on February 18, 2023 with our Delta One flight from Atlanta when we had to sit on the plane for over an hour because of some unknown maintenance issues before taking off late. Once we landed at Kahului, HI airport we sat on the tarmac for two hours before pulling up to the gate to unload. We were told by the pilot the reason was we had such a strong tailwind arriving early (not the case) along with many planes ahead of us that needed unloaded too. Thus, everyone had to sit on this plane for over 13 hours! On February 25, 2023 on our return Flight from Maui, HI we boarded the plane 1.5 hours later than scheduled because our plane had been sitting out on the tarmac for some reason waiting to pull up the the gate delaying our take-off by this long. When we boarded our Flight in Atlanta to return to Cleveland we sat in the plane for 1.5 hours being told by the pilot there were maintenance issues and ultimately had to add more fuel to the plane and waiting for the fuel truck to arrive with no estimated time being provided by anyone. All of these delays seem to be preventable by improvements in customer service i.e., better communications and your maintenance practices such as fuelling planes needs improved.

When I checked in via phone, I received confirmation of checking in, but no indication of the need to choose a seat. When I arrived at the airport, I was shocked to discover that I no longer had a seat on the plan. After a long conversation with a very unhelpful and unsympathetic agent, he assigned me to a window seat in the very back of the plane. The plane was dirty, smelly, and only one of the video screens in our row actually worked, which made even more people angry. My daughter and grandson were told they didn't have seats on the plane at all and had to wait until the whole plane was loaded to be placed in random seats, so our party could not sit together.

My international leg from Tokyo to Detroit was decent-comfortable comfort plus seat, entertainment and amenities. The crew aboard was an older team, hence just went through the motions without much personal touch. The meals on the international leg left a lot to be desired as it lacked quantity and substance. I was hungry. My second leg was nice too. Crew were very friendly, present and eager to provide customer service. Enjoyed the abundance of free snacks and drink rounds.

Prior to take off one of the crew members was quite rude to a Spanish speaking customer, made a comment about how he needed to learn English and kept on complaining to his co-worker how tired he was and this and that. Definitely not professional, and non the less rude especially considering you’re on a flight from Latin America to the United States. Every seat had a blanket and pillow, prior to take off we were provided with hand sanitizer, a small amenity kit with ear plugs and an eye mask and headphones. After take off drinks and a small snack consisting of a cold pastry with chicken, fruit and a chocolate were given out along with drinks including alcoholic beverages. In the back galley there were snacks for anyone who wasn’t asleep on this red eye. Aside from that crew member everyone else was very professional and nice as usual.

My emotions aside, this company simply does not feel the need to care for their passengers. Our well being and experience simply takes the backseat, and their frontline people hide behind the process and simply shrug it off. We are simply cargo to them, and cargo can be shuffled around and delayed with no consequences. They surely do not live up to their tone-deaf advertisements they make us watch prior to takeoff. What grinds my gears even more is that they will make you move a pound of language from one bag and right into another because of 'weight limit'. Defies all logic. All bags - by weight and volume still ends up on the same plane. Why would a company have processes in place to add to the passenger frustration, and intentionally not do anything about it.

I’m assuming the people on the grounds are also working as hard as they can. But you as a company suck. You have over-extended yourself and make promises to customers that you never follow through with and you believe that your vouchers and your credits will make it better. I don’t travel a ton. In fact, maybe once a year, but I am seasoned. I have never flown Delta until this time to Hawaii from Denver. I have never been so disappointed in my life. Delta behaved like it never knew any type of weather existed or knowledge of the workings of an airport. I understand there are always going to be limitations. I have been through delays but nothing like this. My first delay from this trip was due to weather from another city - fine. But it was delayed even further because when we were got to Seattle, there wasn’t a loading bridge that could unload us from the airplane - it was coming from the S gate to the A gate and the pilot didn’t know why. We missed our flight to Hawaii by 10 minutes and couldn’t get one until the next day. If you don’t have the workers/materials or have the workings of the flight even if delayed planned out, don’t make these promises that you can get us there. Do your due diligence and make sure things are running smoothly at the airports you do business at. The next day when we flew out of Seattle to Hawaii - they had to taxi us back due to mechanical issues. After about 45 minutes, I thanked the mechanics after they departed and we were off. Better safe than sorry for this delay. And now that I’m thinking about it, this was Hawaiian airlines. I do have to say when we did land in Hawaii that day, the luggage people at Delta went way beyond my expectations! It was waiting at their customer service office. Coming home from the LA airport was also a terrible experience. We were of course delayed (no reason given) which was fine but when we were all boarded, we were having issues with the push off tug and we were delayed another hour because we had to wait for another one then when we finally made it to Denver at around 11:30, we had to sit on the plane for two hours with really no true explanation as to why. There were two planes that passed us by & they both went to their unloading gate. I understand weather, I understand shortages of workers but Delta acted as if does not. Don’t offer flights if you can’t follow through to just attempt to get us to the gate in a timely manner. Again the employees were top notch except for your customer service via chat - they couldn’t do nearly as much as when we waited in line for two hours to talk to a human which I’ll never understand why either - my questions were the same.

We spent over $600 for each ticket one way for this abysmal service. Not to mention a blizzard is forecasted for the Midwest and they will most likely cancel the flight.

One leg of my returning flight was cancelled 2 days prior to my outbound departure. Me and my entire family was denied boarding until we get it sorted out with Delta Customer Service - all this at the airport, with the Delta personnel at the check in desk telling us while pointing to the service phone: You need to call Delta Customer Support first.

Employees sent us to desk agents in the airport who providing us with assistance. The desk I went to was the International assistance desk I believe. I happened to get in line first so that was a plus. Agents Kimberly and Dexter were assisting us and they were phenomenal. They helped with all information and kept me calm at a time where I was worried. I was provided with a hotel voucher and chose to lodge at the AC Marriott Gateway. I shuttled to the domestic terminal, got on the sky train and shuttled to the hotel. I didn’t like having to put down an incidental card at the hotel which authorized $20 as this expense was not in my budget but I understood it. Overall I was pleased with the accommodations made for me and really appreciate how helpful every employee was as I was asking directional questions to various workers along the way. Some employees appeared off the clock and still helped me with a smile. I have only flown five times and this is the first time I have ever had a delay.

I realized that I needed one more day to do everything we want to on our vacation. So, my husband and I, sitting together, each on our delta apps went to change our flight. We didn't book on one booking because I used a voucher, and we used miles for KY husband. When you use a voucher it has to be on its own booking...which is annoying. Anyway, sitting together, at the exact same time, side by side, we go and change our flights. I was pleasantly surprised as I received a $50 credit by making the change. However, my husband's change errored out. Apparently he had to pay MORE miles to move the day, for the exact same change I received credit for. The explanation was that prices are subject to change at any time, but since it was the same time it made no sense. So anyway, I can't help but believe they gouge prices when redeeming miles. There is no other reason mine would have resulted in a credit. And his required an additonal 6000 miles. We had issues with our Hawaii trip as well.

Before you are duped big time into buying DELTA Comfort Plus Class - you are out of your minds crazy! How do I know that you ask, because my family did! Here is what you actually get for all of that extra money you spent: You get the most awful selection of alcohol you ever want to consume! Wine in a can that is so bitter that you cannot take more than 3 tiny sips, if you can stomach that much. I really want to know...hey Delta where are the upgraded snacks? Because they were not on any of our 6 (indeed I said 6 flights!) Also I was freezing and according to the Delta website under ""COMFORT PLUS"" it clearly says complimentary pillow and blanket! When I asked my flight attendant for the little pillow and blanket, she looked at me like I was from another planet and said: ""We don't have any pillows or blankets Ma'am"". Just in case anyone should want to know our flights were on: Wednesday, September 21st, 2022. The first flight was Delta# 2836 going from Billings to Minneapolis, the second was Delta#2089 going from Minneapolis to Los Angeles, the third was Delta #0370 going to Hawaii. The fourth was Delta #DL523 going from Kona Hawaii to Los Angeles, the fifth was Delta #DL1145  going from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City and the final flight was Delta #3817 back to Billings. Our family spent thousands of dollars more just to get the extras of ""COMFORT PLUS""! Was it worth it? Considering we never received what was promised in their own description, I would say a big and huge hell no! You can all think that I am whining and whatever, but I want what I was promised and what I paid for. There is no more leg room in COMFORT PLUS than in Economy! Basically the only difference is that you get seated a tiny bit quicker. Same drinks and snacks. There are no pillows as advertised. However if you have a longer flight you will get very thin and blue hospital like small throw. In no way can it ever be compared to a ""blanket"".

We were flying from Atlanta-GA to New York, then Tel Aviv - Israel. A trip that I had been doing for years with different Airlines. On December, 18th 2021, I got to the Airport 3 hours before the flight, as they requested, but the check-in line was moving extremely slowly. After about 1 hour and a half, I asked an employee to please help us make it in time for our flight. He assured me that we had enough time. Another half hour went by and I saw this person again. I went towards him and said I had one more hour to my flight with my kids and there were still a lot of people in front of me. Again, he was dismissive and said we would be able to make it on time. We finally made it to the check-in desk, got our boarding passes to the NY flight and the connecting flight to Israel and ran to security. I took it upon myself and apologized to all the people we were passing to get through security and get to our gate. Just as we got to the gate, the plane was already moving. We got there late. I was livid and I made it very clear that I was angry. The problem was that they knew we were on our way. We had already checked in, our names were on the list with assigned seats, and we had the boarding passes in our hands. I’m willing to bet that due to extremely bad management, they overbooked the plane; that is why they quickly closed the door and allowed the plane to take off. Eventually, a Delta Employee was able to put my kids and I on another flight to NY.  When we got to the gate, they had just closed it and refused to reopen it. I said to the employee “You knew we were on our way, our names were on the list. Why didn’t you wait for just 2 minutes? She did not answer, but again it’s obvious that they overbooked the plane. By now, I was going to miss our flight to Israel as well. I don’t think there was anyone on that terminal that did not hear my voice when I was yelling and screaming off the top of my lungs that Delta and its management are nothing but screw-ups and they don't care about their clients At this point someone came and told me she could help and would make sure that I would be on the next flight. However, we were going to miss the flight to Israel but there would be another flight in the evening that we would have to wait for (if I’m not mistaken about 6 hours). I did not care. I asked her to do whatever needed to be done. She started transferring our boarding passes from the flights we lost to the new flight to NY and the flight to Israel that same evening. However, she was only able to issue my and two of my kids boarding passes, but was having a problem getting the boarding pass for my other son. Time was getting very close to the flight going to NY, so she asked me to leave and in NY they would get him the boarding pass. When we got to NY, the first thing I wanted to do was to get my son his boarding pass. I went immediately to the Delta desk; the person there was taking forever, then someone else came in and started asking my son for his permit to travel and his Covid test. I told them that we had already been through this and he already had a boarding pass, but because of Delta’s poor management and flawed service, we lost 3 flights.

Practically everyone associated with my trip on Delta (with the exception of the pilot, who I only saw once as I de-boarded the plane) was not only rude but personally insulting. Waiting at the gate for the last leg of my trip, a flight from Atlanta to Kansas City, two female employees at the gate counter acted like they were in a high school girl's bathroom - cackling and laughing like witches over the intercom mike while blurting out info about boarding the flight. I'd never heard such juvenile and unprofessional behavior before, and the whole time I asked myself why would a company hire these characters. Pickings must be extremely slim. The flight attendants at the front of the plane waiting as I boarded the plane were no better. The male-female duo were rating the looks of passengers as they came on board: ""That's a two"" said the female. ""No, that's a one and a half"" said the male attendant. Naturally, as usual, they were two extremely gorgeous specimens who had plenty to say about other people in the looks department, like most of these extremely rude types of characters do. If I didn't have to get to my destination on time with more important things to attend to than rude flight attendants I would have stopped and reprimanded them, but I wisely kept moving to my seat. I've dealt with some real bad apples on a number of these airlines, just trying to get from point A to point B, and I realize that the service industry in general is going down, but this experience on Delta Airlines was the worst yet and is putting me off of flying altogether. It's not bad enough how paying passengers are treated during the pre-flight checks, but then you have to go through the insulting, rude and unprofessional conduct of the Delta counter people and flight attendants.

I found some flights that worked for my schedule and they happened to be Delta whom I do not typically choose as travel partners. I had coordinated plans with people based on my itinerary but unfortunately found out, that when flying with Delta, a set schedule is always subject to change and your efforts to be a dependable person in regard to your commitment is jeopardized with their great ineptitude of being a reliable transportation service. It might be easiest to understand my disappointment and frustration by simply looking at the attachments of the update texts. From all of my other travel experiences, which I am fortunate and grateful to say is plenty and well above average, I usually receive 1-2 update texts mostly with confirmations of flight and gate information. Delta operates differently than their competitors however as they like to send 10-12 texts with new gate information and change of departure times. For those who like spontaneous adventures, simply book a flight with Delta and you'll be running around the airport all day with changes of departure times every 30-45 minutes! Unfortunately due to all of this irresponsible and unreliable service from Delta, I held many people up and changed a lot of people's schedules simply bc I didn't know when I was going to get in. Eventually plans were canceled and I, with the help of Delta Airlines, ruined a night of fun which was planned a long time in advance. I will say that Delta is consistent in that the return flight was just as bad. I was supposed to take off at 12:15pm and it's currently 5:15pm and our flight has now been pushed back until 7:10pm. Believe me, I'm not holding my breath! In summary though, Delta has proven to me that it is a completely unreliable travel service with little to no regard nor respect for it's customer's time nor plans. If you are someone that would like to pay the same amount of money as their competitors but have no security in when your flight will actually take off, Delta airlines is your best bet.

Delta has the onus since Atlanta is their headquarters and primary global hub, and nearly 75% of all passengers arriving into and departing from Atlanta are using Delta.

My home away from home for decades, equipped with children and a career I need to return to with some semblance of a plan… however, that plan is being obliterated by Kiwi.com/ Delta Airlines as I speak! I’m sitting here, 10 kilometers from Incheon airport, where I shall sit until the first flight to Bali that has a seat available, is willing to transport me. This is all Delta’s doing at the moment, and I cannot believe my own story as I sit back and revel in it while typing. Kiwi.com, however, as a travel agent, is rather complicit in my defenseless position. I’d be happy to tell you my itinerary was put together by Kiwi.com, with a seemingly flawless algorithm, until I realized that this itinerary relies on every facet of transfers, Covid testing, and airline employees executing their job duties in a timely, effective manner. When this chain is disrupted by one weak link working for Delta Airlines, I became occupational hazard in the flesh, missing flights, having to pay unreal sums of money because we have flight stewards who aren’t attuned to my needs. I started July 26th, 2022 with a flight from Austin, Texas, USA scheduled to 8pm… From there to go on to Houston, TX with an 11 hour layover before boarding my Seoul, S. Korea flight, and ultimately from S. Korea to Bali, Indonesia.  My first July 26th flight from Austin to Houston was canceled and rescheduled for the following morning - requiring my 2nd flight from Houston to Atlanta (where I would make my connection to Seoul and onwards home to Bali) to be delayed. This was flight DL1315. I had downloaded the Kiwi.com App as recommended to receive updates and none of this information was posted there. Kiwi.coms’ app was actually such a joke, that my google profile became the de facto OS for me, alerting me to flight delays and suggesting nearby hotels. First off, I am a foreign national in Indonesia, and my passport and visa paperwork clearly show this. However, the woman at the Delta boarding gate in Houston insisted her computer was not up to date on the half a dozen different visas Indonesia gives its ex-pats, and that I could only enter as a tourist. “Fine” I say, “enter me as a tourist.” But a tourist must show an outbound international flight to enter Indonesia.

I didn't fancy staring into space for 10 hours so I removed my hearing aids and tried my best with the in-ear phones, I turned the volume up full and just about managed to hear the system.

Short, snippy, and sarcastic, the agent seemed to want to have very little to do with us from the minute we stepped to the counter. No smile, no hello, no greeting. And it was all downhill from there. We had been planning for my son to participate in a foreign exchange program for a year and a half. Made all the arrangements, did all the research, and checked all the boxes. We chose Delta because they had an arrival time inside of a time window we needed to meet. Simple enough. He is a minor. He is old enough to opt out of the Delta Unaccompanied Minor program, where they charge an extra $150 and require someone at the destination to jump through a bunch of hoops to pick him up. The host organization already had a process in place. We researched the unaccompanied minor rules and regulations. The host organization would have someone waiting to meet with him at the gate in Japan. No problem. We chose to opt out of the unaccompanied minor program because the Delta website rules specifically state: https://www.delta.com/us/en/children-infant-travel/unaccompanied-minor-program ""If I decline the Unaccompanied Minor Service for my 15-17 year old, can I still accompany them to the gate? Yes. If you are dropping off or picking up your minor but opted out of the Unaccompanied Minor program, we will issue you a pass to accompany your child to the gate. Please check with an airport agent at the time of check-in to have the gate pass issued."" We arrive at the ticket counter to begin the process and the agent is visibly annoyed that she now has to go through all of this process first thing in the morning (visa, passport, covid test verification, etc) and she makes it very clear through her body language and attitude that she is annoyed. Then we get to the part where I request a pass to accompany my son to his gate. She responds ""No. He's old enough to travel by himself."" I mention the rules we had researched, and after some tense back and forth, she says ""no, we're not Southwest."" Now, tensions are escalating and my son is upset. She even walks away at one point to go do something else that seemed completely unrelated to us. I know if I escalate any further, I run the risk of expulsion from the airport, so we take our boarding pass and move away. My son is very upset at this point and asks if there is anything else we can do. We get back in line to try a different agent. This one is even worse. I opened the discussion with a recap of our previous encounter and even showed her the Delta website I had pulled up on my phone. She looks right at it and says the only thing she can do is enroll him in the unaccompanied minor program. So I say, ""ok, let's do that."" She rolls her eyes and her shoulders slump. She leans forward, places her hands face down on the counter looks up with her head cocked to the side and says ""fine. But I'm going to need a lot of information."" She has us fill out a form which is quite comprehensive, then starts pausing at every other word to ask if the spelling is correct. The process drags on so long, and the tension was so uncomfortable, that my son asks if we can just go. I express to them that the amount of trouble to go through this when the rules clearly state that it should amount to a simple request is ridiculous. So my son started his trip alone.

There were a lot of mix ups (we didn’t get the baby bassinet we reserved, we didn’t get the 100% fruit meal we reserved, etc.) and many times it felt like the right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing. The most challenging issue was that the connection flight was several hours late and no genuine support was given for a place to rest which can be especially hard for families with babies and young children. If your priority is health, especially for medical conditions or families with small children, higher quality airlines might be a better fit. The food was fine, not the freshest but not poor quality. They kept advertising about how free the wifi was but when you go in, it’s only free for T-Mobile subscribers (felt like either a bad joke or deliberate deception).

Did not hear from them in next 2 hours, while I was waiting at the check-in counter. Conclusion: Delta do not provide any assistance. Operations is the critical component of their business. I would care less if an airline avoids delays and disruptions (except in cases of extreme weather). For an international traveller, it is not east to navigate airports, or make alternative arrangements in a foreign country, that too in a situation where airport staff speaks language other than yours'.

Wait at the airport for next flight (that was exactly after 12 hours and downgraded from business to economy).Leave my check-in bag with Delta and pick it up on return flight !

Talk about customer care. Delta is not transparent in their conduct or concerned about customer experience.  Ground Staff the most pathetic staff I ever witnessed.  The lady in-charge of ground affairs was outright rude. Did not even listen. I kept pleading for details, but she said she would help me later. I felt a bit arrogance in her attitude. And I did not understand where the staff kept disappearing intermittently. For two and a half hours that I was in checkin line (Sky priority is a joke), I noticed staff behind screen varied between 1 and 4. Perhaps Delta is short staffed. When I managed to reach check-in counter, the lady said I cannot check-in luggage as the deadline for baggage checkin is closed. So, either travel next day (which was not feasible for me) or take bag to the gate. Catch is, I had liquids in checkin bag. So, I had to throw them away. Remember, sometimes it is not about stuff but emotions attached to it. I had something special to me in the bag (Hence my resolve to avoid Delta as much as I can). The thing that made me furious is that flight stood at the gate for another 1hour 15 minutes after boarding completed.

My flight got finally canceled after more than 3 hrs frustrating hours. The only compensation I got was $30 meal vouchers and a complimentary hotel Night that I didn’t use because the queue was so long and I got the email so late at night that I already booked the hotel.

"Family Leisure","Business Class","05-22","no",5,1,2,3,4,5,1," This is by far my worst flying experience in my life and I’ve been flying since the age of 4 which is 40 years ago and I’ve flown with many international airlines across the globe. This airline is a joke doesn’t even qualify to be a budget LLC. I flew with them 4 sectors all in first class including delta one. First leg was SEA-LAX first class in a very old 30+ years old B737 after boarding and take off and the pilot switch off the seat belt sign I asked the notorious cabin crew if I can use the toilet and I was the very first passenger to use what’s supposed to be the first class cabin toilet and it was filthy and floor full of water and when I informed the FA he said yes it’s flooding. Prior to my departure Delta sent me via their app to choose my meals and since I have specific dietary requirements I choose what’s suitable for me. When the FA was offering the meals he came to me and with a very low and unclear tone he offered me what options they have and when I told him I have a special meal request he said we don’t serve that on domestic flights so eventually I took the oat meal with some shea seeds which turned to be an awful non edible option. After landing and waiting for my luggage I found my suitcase was damaged beyond repair I went to Delta luggage service desk I spoke with the employee who was very unhelpful and not interested to be working she just did a form and gave it to me with a tracking number and till today after almost a month still I didn’t hear from their customer service. My 2nd leg was from LAX-JFK supposed to be with B767-400 the newly refurbished delta one. As per Delta email prior to departure we need to be 2 hrs prior to departure at the airport which is 4am I was there on time and they said there is a dedicated lounge for delta one passengers . There was no one at the check in counters as they said they open by 4 am and to my surprise the Delta one dedicated check in lounge is just a partition of the check in area separated by a partition. We waited till 4:30am one one employee finally showed up and opened the partition and we did our check in finally. The only positive thing was the new delta lounge at LAX . Food options were horrible though. We boarded surprisingly to a very old dirty B767-300 with the old version of Delta one seats. Probably 25+ years old aircraft which was falling apart. Started taxing on time however for almost 1 hr the pilot was taxing around the airport and at 7 am he informed us we are going back to the gate as the plane developed a technical problem which need another hr of repair and we ended up sitting on board for another 2 hrs without even a glass of water or any interaction from the crew we eventually took off at almost 9 am 3 hrs behind our schedule and to my surprise the FA came to me and said you requested for a special meal and it’s ready so they actually serve pre ordered meals on domestic flights. Anyways we landed in JFK almost 3 hrs behind schedule at 5pm instead of 2:15 and I had to rush to catch my 7pm appointment which was so stressful with NYC traffic. The other 2 flights were nothing special LGA-BOS and BOS-DCA we’re both on old dirty EMB175 however we’re very short flights. Conclusion never again on this joke airline.

We were placed on a much later flight that would set us to miss an entire day of already-paid-in-full vacation. We were able to change the flight to an earlier, similar flight. Baggage drop was difficult. We arrived to the airport 2.5 hours early. We also paid an additional $200 to book a hotel next to the airport to ensure this early arrival. This would not have been necessary if not for Delta’s cancellation of our flight. Even with staying at the airport hotel and arriving nearly three hours prior to our flight, baggage check took almost two hours. Despite so many cancellations, Delta staff did not seem to be moving with any sense of urgency for their travelers. Once on our flight, we were set to arrive in Atlanta and connect to a flight to Daytona. When we landed, we discovered that our connecting flight was cancelled midair. We did not receive any notification of this change- no text or call. After speaking to customer service at the ATL airport, we discovered that there was only one other flight to Daytona, our destination. Staff said that it may also be cancelled be we are welcome to select that flight. Ultimately, we were placed on standby for Orlando flights. We were able to barely catch the next flight out. Three Delta staff members assured me my baggage would follow me there. It did not. Since we arrived at the incorrect destination, the rental car company charged us an additional $500 to provide us with a rental car in Orlando. I created a baggage claim with Delta Baggage Claim Customer Service in MCO airport. ^he agent interrupted me often and was very short with me. It was poor customer service that I did not appreciate. She assured me that my luggage would be placed on a flight to either Orlando or Daytona and then delivered to my hotel. Several hours later, my luggage was placed on a flight to Orlando. It has now been at the MCO airport for hours. I cannot reach anyone about delivery. It will be a three hour trip there and back to retrieve my luggage. As for tonight, I have no toiletries or clothes. I cannot even brush my teeth, change my undies, or even swim in a swimsuit because I have no luggage. Delta should be embarrassed and ashamed. As a company, they should not be booking flights that cannot take off due to staff shortages. I am not looking forward to our return flights at all. I am honestly worried these flights will be cancelled as well. I feel that we should receive significant compensation for our difficulty and additional costs due to Delta’s poor travel management skills.

At 6:45 am I called Delta customer service. I was on the line for one hour and 47 minutes and during this time I did speak with an agent and she was not able to help us. She transferred us to her supervisor, and was disconnected after being on the line for almost 2 hours. We were still at the airport waiting to get rescheduled and still was told that no one could help us and to call the 1-800 number. I called back at 10:05 am and talked with another agent. I was on hold for one hour until I was told that she was not able to do anything, but would submit this to someone who was able to help us. Also, I was told a few times by customer service that there were over 2000 calls from customers that were waiting to be rescheduled and felt that we were one in 2000 and not that important. We were disconnected as well but she called us back even though Delta's protocol is to not call customers back that get disconnected from calls. Finally, by 2pm, our flights were finally rescheduled for the next day. This has been a horrible experience. Delta is awful to work with and I will never fly with them again. The fact that they had over 2000 people waiting on hold to get rescheduled and that I had to spend over 8 hours on the phone to get a flight reschedules is completely unacceptable.

"Business","Economy Class","05-22","no",2,1,1,1,1,1,1,"  Delta's non-international first class is to me, a waste of money. I travelled from Sarasota, FL to Kansas City International return and spent $293 extra for first class over the comfort plus seating. Both trips were via Atlanta. I had never travelled first with Delta, so thought I would give it a try. You get early boarding, but as your seat is designated, that is really unimportant. There are as much booze and hot/cold drinks as you want, but no food, only snacks. The second leg, ATL-KCI, was over 2 hours. Delta should serve at least a sandwich/yoghurt etc for that duration. As the journey is under 900 miles you are stuck with snacks. The seats on the Boeing 757-200 and 737-900 have no lumbar support at all and I found them very uncomfortable. Bring a pillow or inflatable cushion would be my advice. On the 737, I was at the back of first class and my seat had zero recline. It was all that was available when I purchased the ticket. I had 2.5 and 3.5 hour waits at Atlanta for the next plane and was hoping as I paid for first class, a lounge would be available. No such luck. You have to be an international traveller or own a special credit card, like Delta's own or I think, AmEx. On Delta's website, I could not find any info about lounge availability, so emailed them. I'm still waiting for a reply some 3 weeks later. I tried to call, do you really need me to tell you the wait time? It's true you have 21 ins of seat width and 37 inch pitch.

My husband and I landed a few minutes early, however, once we stepped off the plane, everything changed. We endured the worst airport experience ever in our combined 109 years. We had 1 hour to deboard and take the train to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Panama City, FL (ECP). After rushing to get to the other terminal, we were disappointed to see on the screen that our flight to ECP had been canceled. About that same time I received a text from Delta that due to the inconvenience, they would provide us with a complementary hotel room from a list of hotels they provided and a complementary meal. I attempted to reserve a room at one of the hotels provided, only to find that all within 30 miles of the airport were booked. We made our way back to the main terminal and proceeded to stand in a long and winding line at the ticket counter. By this time, it was about 10:30 pm. While waiting in line, I checked the Delta website for the next flights going to ECP. There were no more flights that night, all flights the following day were sold out, and all were sold out two days later except for the late flight that had a few seats remaining. I called Delta Customer Service thinking this may be quicker than waiting in line at the airport, however, the wait time to speak with a CSR was 3+ hours. After waiting in line for over 2 hours and next in line, a Delta staff member walked by the line and asked what we needed. I explained our situation that our connecting flight was canceled, according to website all flights were sold out the next 2 days and none of the complementary hotels had rooms available and was told ""you'll have to wait until next week to get to FL."" About that time, another Delta staff member said they were closing the line down because it was past time for them to go home. We proceeded to the baggage area and waited another hour in line to get our bags and were advised we could not get them that they would be on the 8 am flight to ECP and we could get them whenever we got to ECP, By this time it was 1:30 am. We had to find our own hotel and transportation ($230 + $60 to hotel + $30 from hotel) and planned on renting a car and driving so we didn't lose 2 more days of our vacation. After getting 3 hours of sleep, we returned to the airport and stood in line at Dollar Rental for 2.5 hours before deciding to go back to the airport terminal to see if they had any seat cancellations to ECP or other airports within 2 hours. We waited in line 2 more hours to finally get a Delta staff member who actually was trying to help. She was able to get me on a late afternoon flight and my husband on a flight that evening. I received a $100 credit from Delta for the inconvenience (my husband did not) and $15 voucher for a meal. But, considering we spent $320 on the hotel and transportation to and from hotel, and lost a day of vacation, we are out several hundred. Not to mention I canceled the return flight and rebooked on SW and only received a partial credit. Although I realize there is a shortage in pilots and many flights are being canceled, there needs to be a process set up to ensure those whose flights have been canceled are rescheduled on flights as soon as possible, instead of standing in line after line and not getting anything accomplished.

Mostly because of Covid I planned my trip by train the rides (round trip) were canceled do to Covid and related personnel issues. So, the price was much higher for this round trip to Florida than anticipated. It was a little tricky to get Delta for every flight. We all hear the news about mask wearing. There are two sides to every story as they say. I have always followed the rules. So, of course I wore my mask with some discomfort. Most people complied with this law for mass transit. I did notice many airline personnel without masks. I am one to mind my own business; but I believe you lead through example. My main problem with flying anymore is the long lines-hurry up and wait. I do have metal implants that can set off security alarm systems at courthouses and airport. I also mention this. So, of course I had to be patted down. i do not like this procedure, but wanting to complete my travel plans i complied. I carry prescriptions that can easily show up on x ray, but most of the pills I carry are holistic supplements. I am sure that my ""misplaced"" luggage was no accident. This has happened to friends in the past and to my husband several years ago( Delta for sure). So, it is my belief airlines are too interested in our personal belongings. Anytime a bag was lost or delayed that said luggage contained medicine, both prescription and holistic. Air travel is very expensive and keeps going up. The inconvenience was just too much during this last trip. In my opinion Delta has higher standards than the other airlines. If i have to travel by air again I know I will choose them. Upon arrival back into Albany in March we took an awful bump upon landing. The flight was from LaGuardia to Albany around five in the afternoon. I have flown often in the past and many international flights. That was the worst landing I ever experienced.  If Delta or any airlines wants to keep customers flying they have much work to do.

"Couple Leisure","Economy Class","11-21","yes",1,2,3,4,1,1,1,"  Let me just start by saying, riding with Delta this past Sunday was a major inconvenience. On April 3rd I arrived at the airport around 4am to catch my 6.45am flight that would later connect to another flight in ATL. My first flight of that day went smoothly, and I took note as to how the different groups of passengers were being called as to not overcrowd the area. As I had previously flown into CHI using a connecting flight, I had plans to be back in Austin by 12pm so that I could make it to work later that day. When I arrived in ATL, I walked over to station B28 as to be ready to board the plane. I arrived early and I paid close attention as the passengers were called to board the plane, however the screen never changed from saying “PRORITY”. As the announcer called passengers, she announced 1st class, main cabin 1, main cabin 2 and main cabin 3 but to my confusion she never announced BASIC. As time neared for my flight to leave, my roommate and I walked over to the station to ask when they would announce for “BASIC” to board the plane. I watched as a woman and her daughter were helped to board the plane and I stepped up to be boarded right after her. The lady spoke with me and said “I’ll be right back” before closing the door to the plane in front of me and a group containing at least 5 other passengers. The conversation that commenced after her return was very sad when referring to customer service. Not only was she rude to me as a passenger but she seemingly taunted the fact that my flight left without me on board. As she faced me, there was a lady in a red suit to her left who also claimed she wanted to help but offered a 4.40pm flight as a substitute for my 10am flight, omitting the fact that there was a 12.30am flight that she had access to add us to as standby passengers. Both ladies are a poor excuse for employees at a company that is supposed to pride themselves in customer service. Taking the conversation from 0 to 100, I believe it took more effort to be rude then it did to just help us and apologize for the inconvenience. They argued the fact, saying that I was not at the door when I clearly contacted her before she turned her back on me. Not only were the two ladies rude but they seemingly meant harm in their demeanor, and they wanted my flight to leave me behind. As a customer, I am feeling very deterred to ride with Delta again because if I paid for a flight, I should be able to ride on my flight without complications and poor attitudes from staff. I feel these two ladies were upset with the fact that passengers were slow to accept checking their luggage and they decided to take out their frustrations on the passengers. After getting help at the main Delta help desk, I felt like the employee wanted to be helpful, but the conversation could only be what I feel was “he said she said.” As the lady could do nothing to help me further with submitting a complaint about my previous interaction with the staff at B28 at 10am. The rude behavior from your Delta employees persisted and even as I was placed on standby flight for 12:31am I was still not properly confirmed on my flight. I went to the desk of station B5 and when I asked if he could explain what “standby” meant he rudely told me “Look at the screen” as he continued his conversation with a coworker.

I went to back to the airport and checked with lost and found etc but it had not been turned in. Thankfully a flight attendant called me and told me she found my wallet on the plane but she was now in Detroit with it. She was trying to figure out a way to get it on a returning flight to Charlotte that day, with another flight attendant or she was going to bring it herself in two days on a returning flight. It seemed it would all work out and then the Gate manager got involved and confiscated it from the flight attendant. The gate manager promised the flight attendant that they would call me ASAP but no one called. (Still no call three days later). I called the Detroit Delta Lost and Found, the next morning, and spoke to an agent and explained that the wallet was located and positively handed off to the Manager of all the Delta gates at A27 on March 27th. The gate manager is aware of who I am and my wallet. The woman on the phone said to me that they had not retrieved any of the found items from the gates and it wasnt really a priority! I exclaimed that I was stranded in Charlotte until I could get my wallet back. I begged her to take my phone number and She rudely told me to fill out an online report. That was it! I did as she asked and waited all day. Its now three days later and I am still waiting. I had to cancel my flight. I'm missing work and I have no money or ID. I cant believe how unhelpful Delta has been. I will never fly again with this airline. I should mention that the first blow was that on my 5.5 hour red eye flight from SFO to Atlanta we were not offered anything to drink. Not even water. when I asked the flight attendant, he was very rude and returned with a half full plastic cup of water. I was extremely dehydrated the entire flight. Delta is terrible.

So they cancelled my return ticket and I only discovered about it a few hours before my return flight. On top of my distress (I was trying to figure out a way to go back home, there were no other available flights until the next day) the person at the desk was super rude saying ""it was my fault"": I showed up at their gate with the correct boarding pass and they messed things up afterwards, with multiple employees involved in the process and I am the person to be blamed here? Spent ridiculously long hours on their customer help lines just to reach a single person to talk to (6 hours for a single call) and ended up with literal ""nothing"" other than a wasted ticket, money spent on an overly-priced flight to get back home, hours and hours of distress and unkind behavior from their part, all on top of their own mistake.",2.85714285714286,"Not Verified","Newark","Los Angeles"

The ticket desk wasn't open, so we were stuck in the lobby with dozens of other passengers for over an hour. This caused a massive crowd and lots of confusion going thru airport security. As if that wasn't bad enough, for whatever reason despite my husband and I being ticketed on the same confirmation, we weren't assigned seats next to each other. When he made the reservations, he made sure to request a window seat for me but somehow Delta assigned us to middle seats on the opposite side of the aisle. He spent over 2 hours on hold on Saturday trying to get our seats reassigned so we would be next to each other, only for the customer service agent to tell him that we would need to speak to the agent at the desk to get reassigned. My husband tried to ask, but couldn't even finish asking his question because the agent cut him off and rudely announced over the intercom that there would be no seat reassignments. He asked the flight crew as we boarded, only to be met with blank stares and headshakes. They were unwilling to move other passengers to keep us together. We were now at the mercy of our fellow passengers, none of which were willing to switch seats to keep us together. I’m sure you’re wondering why this is important. I’ve flown frequently, and have noticed that sitting in the middle causes me to have anxiety, motion sickness, and feelings of claustrophobia. And this was all exaggerated by having to wear a mask for a prolonged period of time. My only chance for comfort on this flight, was having my husband by my side, and being switched to a window or aisle seat. I almost immediately had the worst panic attack of my life. Full out crying and shaking. The flight crew walked up and down the aisles past me, not caring that they played a part in my suffering by not moving other passengers to keep me with my husband. And my husband was unable to comfort me, being stuck across the aisle and between two strangers, so this flight was rough on him too. Finally, when one of the flight attendants did ask me what was wrong (while pushing the drink cart up the aisle) I told him, thru my tears, that I needed my husband. He asked me where my husband was, and I told him, but he did nothing to correct my situation. My panic attack lasted the duration of the flight.  I couldn’t get off the plane fast enough. I was so shaken that I didn’t want to get on our connecting flight.  All in all, your team had several opportunities to correct the situation, and dropped the ball repeatedly.

Now it is down to anywhere from two to five hours. Delta requires human contact for many minor details (such as bringing a dog). But contacting a human at Delta is virtually impossible. And they are generally rude and unhelpful after I spend hours trying to make contact. I have been cut off several times after being connected. The virtual assistants are terrible, too. How can a computer be so stupid? It has been programmed into it. The virtual assistants keep repeating the same information and questions and do not understand what is input by voice or typed.

Friendly and caring, showing that they really like their job and they are enjoying what they are doing. Off to a great start. A flight attendant specifically, has shown care and compassion throughout the flight to us. Off to a great start, Delta. Now, talking about comfort. The Delta One suite offered a comfortable space. I'm not tall, so I didn't experience any discomfort. It was heading straight, except for some curves which some other premium cabins consider for their business/first suites. Heading over to entertainment. It was truly a great variety, featuring all genres of movies and even new releases! But the music had its limitations, even by having a collaboration with Spotify. But it was good nonetheless. Wi-Fi wasn't connecting to my laptop, but it connected to my phone without a problem. Now talking about the food. It was absolutely delicious with its really premium feel to it, with 3 options. We were served lunch and breakfast. Between both meals, we could have snacks at any time if we felt hungry.

My last flight which was an overnight flight from LAX to Fort Lauderdale, which I booked business class. When I booked, I specifically asked if the flight had beds in the 1st/business class and I was told it did. Otherwise, I would never have spent the money I did to fly 1st/business overnight. Not only was there no bed - the seats didn't recline anymore then in the main cabin. I realize this sounds obnoxious to be complaining about 1st/business class seating. The issue is how much we pay for the seat and what it suppose to represent. Not only was there no bed or even an upgraded recliner seat, there were no blankets, no pillows, no service and a little snack in a cardboard box! It's pathetic and all under the disguise of Covid, yet all restaurants are open and serving people. Worst of all - the outbound flight was freezing. The cabin temperature was less then 65 degrees the whole trip. It was miserable! When I asked over and over for the cabin to be a bit warmer I was told how the cabin temp. was not controlled for my comfort, but rather the whole flight. I get it, but everyone was complaining. I won't even get started on the how aggressive the flight attendant was about masks up during sips of our drink. It's all shameful! I work very hard for my living, and in my business.

He is very physically fit. His knees were against the back of the seat in front of us. The seats were so narrow and tightly squeezed that he started to have a panic attack and got sick.

I asked the desk attendant about why their comfort seats aren't larger or more spacious and she said ""you're not paying for more room, you're paying for amenities."" Really? So I paid $400 more for a bag of chips and a $1.00 set of ear phones? Yes. Theoretically, the comfort plus is supposed to get on first to get that precious bag space above the seats, but even that backfired, as they allow anyone to go on during their ""comfort plus"" seating and although I sat in row 10, my bag had to be put over seat 16 which made retrieving it after the flight a nightmare.

She approached us almost scolding at my husband for not being in his seat and snatched the headphone away. It wasn’t about the seat being premium since the amenities were subpar to begin with. I’m not upset because of him going back to the seat but they were horrific and rude about it. They were both hostile towards me in a condescending tone.  As we were about to land my husband moved up so that he could retrieve the luggage from the overhead bin but the head flight attendant stormed over and said he could not sit there. I asked for her name and she raised her voice saying that she did nothing wrong.  As I was getting off the plane she told me to wait for a customer service person to speak to me. After a 10 hour flight the last thing I want is to wait even longer at the airport. She then responded with ‘whatever’. I’m horrified with her unprofessional behavior.

What I did not expect was the flight booked with Virgin internationally would be with Delta also. The whole point of booking with Virgin was to travel with Virgin. I will be asking questions of them also. I was not told there would be a change until it came time to check in, and by then I could not change without losing money. Delta check in was OK. The crew seemed impatient at passengers taking their time to sit down and get comfortable. One female crew member was quite rude and sarcastic. Food was atrocious, and on an 8 to 9 hour flight we had one meal, and a snack. I talked to another passenger and she agreed, they didn't feed us very much. The flight itself was fine, and the crew member I had was lovely. My point being: Crew was not welcoming or even enthusiastic. Your passengers might have saved for the two years of Covid, looking forward to their holiday, encountering this experience, and dreading their return flight. The change from Virgin to Delta - I know this may not be your fault. The overall Delta experience was just not pleasant, and it should at least be that. I fly enough to know the good from the bad from the reasonable, and this experience was somewhere between the last two. Virgin on the way back, a whole other story - beautiful uniforms, young, helpful crew, nothing was too much trouble, even went an extra mile or two when I said I was slightly claustrophobic, and went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable.

I am not sure if I was lucky or I am not demanding, but my experience with the airline was quite fine so far (knock on wood). It is certainly not top notch but not horrible either. I, for sure, have encountered unpleasant experiences, but that happened to me even with the best rated airline. I think US carriers' weak spot is ground operations, with so many short, small flights that are plagued with delays, cancellations and gate changes (Asian full-service carriers use wide-body aircrafts even on one-hour flights). Now, here is my opinion about this particular flight. Ground service at EWR for Premier class was seamless but not exemplary, and that was certainly below the level of Delta One. In-flight hard product was where this flight shined. The 787-10 was shiny and clean. The Polaris seats were comfortable, spacious, and last but not least, provided a great deal of privacy. This was one of, if not the best equipment for a 5-6 hour flight I ever experienced, even when compare with intra-Asia business class from top rated airlines. On board staff were pleasant and accommodating. Food choices were limited, but I can see improvement on the taste. Food service and presentation was not quite at, though were inching back to, pre-pandemic level. The flight departed on-time and arrived early, but we were still late as we had to wait for our arriving gate, a LAX signature. The IFE screen was nice and responsive, though movie selections were not as good as what on Delta. Overall, I have no complaints.",3.42857142857143,"Trip Verified","Austin","Salt Lake City"

Unlike other businesses that are all understaffed they do not give you the option to keep your place in line and receive a call back like everyone else. The fact that they feel somehow like people that are spending hundreds of dollars with them have the ability to do nothing else that sit and listen to hold music.

I needed to catch an earlier flight out of Pittsburgh due to weather and I wanted to get home earlier. The weather actually forced me to wait until it was within 24 hours of the flight. The app has an option for changing your flight within 24 hours built into the UI. It allowed me to go all the way through putting in my CC number and billing info and repeatedly would not work. Now mind you, this is the second time this has happened to me using Deltas app. On both occasions, I had to reach out to customer service for help, and as most of you know who have ever had the displeasure of having a need for their help, you can expect to wait a long time. So after waiting 2 hours for them to reach out to me via their text messaging service, the seats that were available 2 hours prior were gone and the flight I needed was fully booked.

I was then put on standby from MSY to JFK to BOS, managed to get on that flight to JFK, and was supposed to have a 6 hour layover - I was able to switch to flight DL675 to BOS so I wouldn't be getting home at 11 PM, and was told by the Delta employee who rebooked me that my flight would be protected--that was then cancelled, and I was told I could not even get on the standby list for the 8:59 PM flight to BOS that I had switched from. I talked to a Delta employee and asked him to cancel the 7:00 AM flight (5762) I was automatically rebooked onto for the next day and request my luggage so I could leave the airport and take an Amtrak home.

The one competent, nice Delta employee finally requested my bag for me — I then waited another 45 minutes, and then that same employee gave me a file number and took my home address to have my bag delivered to me so I could leave the airport, since it was already 11 PM. By the time I left the airport to go to a hotel so I could catch an Amtrak in the morning, it was too late to cancel my flight, despite the fact that I was told by multiple Delta employees that they cancelled it for me.

One agent told me that if you leave security, you can’t come back through (clearly untrue). One agent told me they could not put me on a partnering airlines flight…I confirmed with someone else that they are required to do so if they cannot serve you (they could not, it was going to be more than 24 hours). So I went back up to counter, asked again more finely and they agreed. But, she “had trouble with the system” miraculously until exactly the minute after I could no longer make that flight. They made people wait for 7 hours in the airport for flights where no crew had been scheduled and none would be coming available, three days in a row. On our last delay, we were told “they hoped our crew, arriving from another city, wouldn’t time out before being able to fly.” I’m sorry, you don’t know whether the crew were waiting for is going to be eligible to fly? Seems like someone should have that information, right? I don’t blame the airline for a cancelled flight, or even 8 cancelled flights.

A duvet, pillow, Tumi amenity kit, noise canceling phones and big water bottle were waiting on my seat. While taxing dinner orders were taken as well as drink choices and throughout the short 5 hour hop back to New York City many rounds of wine were provided. The meal was a veggie sandwich with hummus, some custard which was amazing, salad and wine.

The transatlantic flights were to be on Alitalia, however on September 1 with a hurricane approaching the northeast coast forced a closure of JFK NY airport. As a result Delta offered an alternative flight from Boston to Amsterdam and then to my final destination, Rome. This avoided New York and the hurricane altogether. I thought my departure and arrival problems were resolved until: 1) Although I paid for a premium transatlantic seat, I was given an economy seat. I specifically asked the attendant at the boarding gate to confirm that I had a premium seat. He said I did which was not true and I discovered this after I boarded the plane. Therefore, I can only conclude that the individual at the desk either outright lied or was completely incompetent. Either way he did not care one bit about the customer. 2) Delta delayed my luggage. I arrived in Rome on Thursday. I did not receive my luggage until the following Monday. 3) I tried to get a partial reimbursement from Delta for the cost difference between the economy seat and the premium seat. They have told me that although they were the ones who made the mistake, they could not provide a partial refund and that I would need to go through Alitalia. To date Delta has not provided any assistance in obtaining my partial refund. In fact they have only wasted my time with numerous phone calls with very lengthy waiting time on the phone. Lastly, it took them more then a week to get back to me and tell me that Delta could not help and that I must go through Alitalia.

She hurried us through and pushed us away. Leaving us with more questions than answers. We had to ask someone else, then stand in the long line again to get another agent to explain the whole standby process to us.

We could not wait another day or two in a Florida airport nor Detroit to get a flight home when I had a 14 yr old son with me as well as having to be at work and having to get home to our animals.

My wife was flying first class with my daughter and I was flying comfort plus with my son. Somehow leading up to the flight our seats were changed without any notice. We are traveling with small children and by law they can not sit by themselves. We found out about the seat changes trying to check in 24hrs in advance. We could not fix our seats together and were told (after holding for 6 hours on the phone) to wait until we reached the gate. We arrived at the airport and there was only one gate attendant with a long line of customers. She was not attending to any of them. Finally someone in line spoke up and she was flustered. She dismissed half of the people in line to go sit down. They were told to deal with their issue at the scanning of boarding passes. We were still seat separated from our children. I finally spoke up and she addressed the situation to get us seated together. Our flight departed a bit late and upon approach into BNA our captain notified us that there was heavy weather and we may have to divert to Memphis. He circled three times and aborted the landing at BNA. We landed in Memphis (1/2 hour from BNA) and are notified that we need to refuel before we can go back and to land at BNA as the storm has now cleared. We now hear from the Captain on the PA that he and his cockpit crew have ""timed out"". We are asked to deplane and wait for alternative cockpit crew. Our flight was initially supposed to land at BNA at 5:11pm, It's now 5:55 as we begin to deplane at Memphis. We find ourselves now at an airport with no restaurants open. Our children are starving. I spend $80 buying junk and jerky at the airport store to tide them over. We now hear from the gate that our incoming pilots will not arrive until 8:30pm (which actually turned into 9:45 because of the incoming delayed flight from Atlanta). We contemplate driving ourselves back to BNA, but that would be a 3 hour drive with the kids. We are now held captive in an airport with no food, an extremely long day of travel and no help from Delta staff or crew. They tell us the only thing available at this airport right now is the drinking fountain and then laugh about it. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of planning and customer service coverage the Delta staff. I understand the timing out of pilots, however the situation after the diverted flight should have been handled better. We were not the only parents with upset, hungry and tired children so my feelings here are mutual as all passengers on flight DL386 where unhappy about the lack of customer service and planning. There was nothing offered to snack on let alone to drink. Even as we re-boarded with the new pilot crew. The staff on flight DL386 didn't offer any snacks that we could see from our seats in first class. Yet when the pilots came on board they handed them both large Bistro Snack Boxes. I'm extremely disappointed with Delta and the crew. This situation could have been handled so much better. We finally got to BNA by 10:30pm( 5 hours after our initial arrival time to BNA) It's now 11:30pm by the time we get the kids home. They're now eating at 11:45pm.

"Solo Leisure","Economy Class","11-20","no",1,1,2,1,2,3,1," Worst airline experience ever! I’ve flown many different airlines before, but I’ve never had so many problems like I have with Delta. This was my first and LAST time flying Delta. I had originally booked a roundtrip, direct flight from ONT to ATL months in advance. Then, a few weeks before, the scheduled flight Delta kept changing my return home flight time (3 times). Eventually they had changed it from a departure time of 5pm to 8am, which is a huge difference in time change. Not only did they change the time, but they changed the return airport from ONT to LAX! I was not ok with either of these drastic changes to the flight I originally booked. I called a Delta representative and told him what had happened. He told me he could make the changes and reschedule me to a direct 4:30pm flight. I assumed things were fixed. It wasn’t until the day before my return flight, when I was supposed to check in, did I realize that he still had my flight booked for the wrong airport (LAX). I then had to spent over 3 hrs on hold waiting to speak to a Delta customer service representative, and over a half hour talking to someone to get my flight fixed. She told me all the direct flights to ONT were sold out, and I would have to take a connecting flight which would be later in the evening arriving to ONT at 11:30pm. I asked if I could wait for standby on a direct flight at 5:50pm. She said she would put me on the list for standby. I was waiting early for standby at the airport until all passengers had finished boarding, as I was directed by the gate Delta attendant. They even said there was one seat that I could take, but when they tried adding me to the seat, they said there was a problem. The system couldn’t give me a direct flight because I only paid for a connecting flight. When I showed them that I did pay for a direct flight they said the representative who booked me this morning did it wrong then. And there was nothing they could do for me. No one tried to compensate me for all of the problems Delta caused with my flight. I feel very unappreciated as a customer.

"Family Leisure","Economy Class","08-20","no",1,2,3,4,1,1,2,"Recently this Thursday, I had the worst experience I have ever encountered on a flight. My family and I had important plans to fly into New York, LGA. However, during our flight, about a half an hour away from LGA the captain of the plane informed us we will be having a delay and they will be stopping the plane in Atlanta. We were upset but understood this is due to weather conditions, and they let us know it would probably be a 1-2 hour delay and to stay close to the terminal when we get off the airplane. When we got off, we were then informed that our flight was actually going to be delayed until 8am in the morning! Shocked, we proceeded to find a help desk to see what we were going to do. As we were walking, we noticed another flight that was boarding for the same place we were supposed to go to, LGA! We were so confused on how they were able to go but we were not? We stood in a very long line with only 2 employees at the counter, and we received a hotel voucher for the Radisson which gave us a $40 discount, we still had to pay $108 for the hotel room which was shocking to us! We were also told that we would use the same tickets we had tomorrow morning at the Atlanta Airport. When we asked an Atlanta Airport employee where the shuttle was for the hotel, he looked at us completely clueless and like he was under hard influence of something, so we kept walking and hoped we would eventually find the shuttle ourselves! We were also told the flight would be departing at 8am, so we had to wake up early in the morning and catch the 5.30am shuttle to Atlanta Airport. This is really when the true nightmare began, as we asked an employee where we should go with our tickets, and she told us since we already had the tickets from our delayed flight we could hop in line for the regular security route. So, after waiting 15-20 minutes in line we went up to the employee who scans the boarding passes and was told “We cannot take these passes you need new ones, leave out that exit door” and we were rudely told to leave as the employee got frustrated with us as we were trying to explain our situation. We then got in line for Special Services, which the security employee directed us too by pointing. It was 5.30am and there was no employees there to even help us yet because they were in a briefing, so we were told by another employee they won’t be available until 6am! Astonished, we got in another line for Special Services and waited about 25 more minutes. We were then greeted by a man all the way at the right side corner, and we attempted to explain our situation with him. He got very rude with us and told us our flight was now taking off at 6.30am and that he would not give us new boarding passes and insisted that we could use the same ones we had even after getting kicked out of security! My father tried to explain further to him, and he replied “Would you rather just sit here and argue with me and miss you flight?” I was astonished by this type of treatment, I truly felt like I was highly disrespected after spending over 1000 dollars this month on flights with Delta! He refused to even look at our boarding passes. We then headed over back by security and began trying to explain our situation to another lady who told us we needed new boarding tickets as well.

I waited 40 minutes before I realised no one was going to answer. A third world country would have better service. I flew on the DL952 from DFW to LAX on June 29th 2021. First there was no fast track security for first class passengers which is off putting when you have a significantly more expensive ticket. The lunch box given was pitiful and sad and quite frankly betrayed laziness. We are already past that curve of covid where you can get away with not offering service using that excuse. It is blatantly an act of being cheap on the part of the airline. The service was awful. The young gentleman that served us was probably the least friendly flight attendant I have ever encountered especially given he is serving first class passengers which makes it worse. Unsmiling, unfriendly, looked bored and uninterested in his job. There was a young lady who also came and checked the cabin during take off and landing equally unfriendly and sporting 2 inch white nails which was shocking. This would have been unheard of in a European airline where grooming standards are closer to what they should be, but I guess this is Delta so anything goes, including gross nails. Overall I am not impressed and we fly Delta a lot due to the fact that my partner has the highest status with Delta.

My son's friend's Dad called to ask of I knew that my flights had been cancelled. ""No"" was my reply as this was in no way ever communicated to me. We then checked on the flights of my children and learned that their flights had also been cancelled with no notice. Wow ... not even an e-mail with an update. I called numerous tome with lengthy waits. One morning, I waited 2 hours and 10 minutes, but got through to customer service. I cancelled our flights and the woman on the line asked us to hold while she went to check on the refund. She came back and, before providing us an answer, asked us to call back! Really! Well, I did call back and was put into a queue that stated that I would receive a call in the next 2 hours. Six hours later, I did receive that call. The gentlemen was quite helpful. The tickets had been cancelled and fully refunded...thought no confirmation e-mail evert sent. This little mishap of an experience is now over. I would like to point out, though, that we had this exact same experience last summer with similar flights between Washington Dulles and Rome Fiumincino. These flights were Alitalia flights in both instances. After reading this review, should you still choose to book with Delta, I would strongly recommend you check your flight status on occasion prior to your trip so you do not find yourself standing at the airport on the day you think your are flying only to find your flight has been cancelled.

Followed all standard protocols and abided by all rules. Remind you my flight was booked to leave early A.M. so arrival in Chicago would leave me enough time to get a full day's work in and return to Florida mid-day. Arrived at Fll at 4am. Our flight was at 5:30 am. with a connection in Atlanta. Plane broke on the runway. Then the plane needed fuel, then the plane broke again. Anyways my flight was changed 2 times before we arrived in Atlanta and when we arrived at 8:54 our connection had just left at 9am. Missed that one too. Then they put me on the 11am flight. Last 2 seats but we made it. Arrived in Chicago 4 hours late. And then had to set there until 4pm because they forgot our tools for the job in Atlanta. We missed the appointment to work on the vessel and all reservations were missed. Our return flight was at 10am by luck we had a chance to have a conversation with the yacht owner who was very disappointed and asked if we could at least come come and look at the vessel since we had made the trip up there. The only thing Delta did correct was we schedule our flight for 6:30pm Saturday. Which gave us the time to see the customer. When we made it to boarding and was filing on to the aircraft the flight attendant had an issue with another passenger that we weren't even with who was drinking or drunk not sure as I was not with him. But she advised us to get off the plane. Then she proceeded to tell the captain and redcoat she felt endangered.

"Solo Leisure","Economy Class","12-19","no",1,1,1,1,1,1,1," We were a party of 4 flying from Denver, CO to Maui, HI. We had booked this trip almost 6 months prior, and I had a choice of seats, and picked out the ones I wanted. However this flight was switched a few months back, and although they specified to check the schedule change, which I did, and there was just a few minutes difference in time. I did not think that I would have to check my seats, as I assumed they would transfer with the flight. They did not! I found this out the day before our flight, and I scrambled to find adjoining seating for the 4 of us, and was successful in locating seating for us, it was in the middle and not window seats like I had originally chosen. I called Delta hoping that I would be able to speak with an agent and get things changed. I was told by a recorded message that the wait time could be up to 3 hrs! which is ridiculous, however, I was determined to speak to someone to get changes made to our seating arrangement. 1 hr went by, and then 2! Still no answer. After waiting until 3 hrs and 3 minutes, I decided i had had enough, and took a screen shot to prove to Delta that I had tried to make changes to my seating arrangements to no avail!. On to Baggage Check. Check-In went reasonably well, and the Baggage Check-In Process went fairly quickly. This was the first time we had flown Delta in a long time. We usually travel using Southwest, and are used to their Baggage Check-In and Boarding Process. Needless to say, I was surprised at the baggage fees we were charged. On Southwest your baggage is free! Not the case with Delta. It cost $30 for the 1st checked bag and $40 for a second. For the 4 of us we had 6 bags, and it cost me $200! I should have done more checking on this prior to purchasing tickets. The only reason for flying Delta in the first place was that they fly larger jets to Hawaii than Southwest, and so we thought we'd be more comfortable, which we later found out not to be the case. Next came the boarding process, and after waiting for everyone else to board, finally it was our turn to go and find our seats that I was forced to endure. Our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City was delayed due to an air conditioning issue? In any case it caused enough of a delay that when we landed in Salt Lake City, we were told that they were doing a final boarding call for our flight to Maui. We ran with our carry on luggage down the concourse for about a quarter mile or so, and they were just closing the door on the jetway and informed us that we had just barely made it. We told them that there were a couple of others from our flight also on their way, but they did not seem concerned, and closed the jetway door behind us. Flight to Hawaii was pretty uneventful, but while our beverage requests were taken care of, it was evident that the flight attendants were not happy with their jobs. It seemed like everything that we asked of them was a burden. The snacks are another thing. No variety at all. We were offered the same snacks over and over on each of the 4 legs of our trip. Almonds and Biscoff cookies.  We will be flying Southwest next time. About the only annoying thing about that airline is that you need to be prompt in your check-in 24 hrs in advance in order to get an A or B pass.",1,"Trip Verified","Minneapolis","Seattle"

We had a flight booked with Delta from ATL airport on Father’s Day leaving at 12:15 PM going to JFK Airport . We arrived at the airport three hours early as we try to prepare flying with small children. First we were never told that while traveling with an infant on lap we will be required to formally check in and will not be able to use the kiosk. The lines of formally check in took us about an hour and a half with two young children in a double stroller. We kept telling them was there another way for us to check in or asking for help as both children were not able to tolerate the wait. We were told we had to wait in that line however they were pulling off people with pets to make sure they were checked in on time for their flight. An hour and a half later we finally reached the check-in, we checked in went through security and arrived at the gate at 12:03 PM where there was a whole debacle of people Up in arms as they were flying standby. I tried to make my way up to the counter to explain we had tickets and we’re on this plane. The girl told me we were too late and our tickets were given away and to go to see customer service. There I am traveling with a one-year-old and a three-year-old and our bags trying to get on my flight that they gave our tickets away as we were not there 15 minutes early. However the plane was still there still boarding but they gave our tickets away. We headed to customer service for Delta by the time we got a supervisor involved the plane had already left. Once the supervisor realized this was a mistake made and we should’ve been able to board our scheduled flight he put us on the next flight which was hours later.

Finally being fed up I demanded a callback from a supervisor as in this luggage was medical equipment for my infant daughter. My daughter was born with bilateral hip dislocation and was it a body cast the first half of her life no she currently uses a hip brace to prevent her hips from falling out of place. She is supposed to wear this every night at bedtime this brace cost a few thousand dollars.

"Family Leisure","Economy Class","12-19","no",4,1,2,3,4,1,2,"  May 21st – May 25th 2021, we flew to EYW from PWM with LGA as a stopover. We’d flown to Key West in FLA in October 2020 First Class and Tampa in January Comfort Plus, and loved both trips. What we didn’t realize is that the planes we’d be flying on this time around were smaller. 2 seats on one side, 1 on the other. There was no separation, which eliminated the “exclusive” feel we’d enjoyed with our first trip. Additionally, there were no TV screens. On the December flight, we were able to watch entire feature films. Additionally, each of the four legs of the trip were different in terms of food or drink service. Leg 1 - PWM to LGA we were offered snack boxes in addition to water, drinks, etc. On the shorter LGA to EYW, we were not offered the boxes. On the return trip, no snack boxes were even offered. Added to the substantially downgraded “first class” experience due to the smaller aircraft, this all contributes to an overall sloppy and inconsistent feel, that is to say, “You never know what you’re going to get until you get on board”. On the leg back, we were looking forward to a couple of the new margaritas in the can. They were amazing, having discovered them on the way down. But, they only packed 2 cans for the whole trip for the plane, the attendant says this happens a lot. We’ve had similar experiences where we weren’t able to get water because you’d run out of the little 8 oz bottles. That’s just unacceptable. (As a side note, an 8 oz bottle of water on a 2-3 hour flight offers little in the way of meaningful hydration. I generally ask for two for each of us. Perhaps a more practical size would be more appropriate?) At the Key West airport on the leg back to LGA, we were the last ones to board. Why? Because the young attendant did not call first class. When we asked about it, she said, “well I called Diamond, that’s the same thing.” Well, no, it’s not. This same attendant was very unhelpful when we asked her about boarding passes. On our last trip to KW we had to print boarding passes vs. using our mobile ones. She said she didn’t really know, they prefer printed but that we should be able to use the mobile, well, can we use them or not? Finally, I’m hard of hearing. I understand that there’s not a lot that can be done because of the mask wearing mandates, but you’ve really got to teach your employees how to make clear announcements. How to annunciate properly, speak reasonably slowly and loudly enough. I’ve never felt so discriminated in my life, having to ask people around me if you’d said anything important. (Most of them didn’t hear the announcements either). On the first leg from PWM to LGA there was one young lady who was wonderful. Every other attendant gave us the impression that we were a bother. So all in all, we paid for a first class experience, and did not receive it on several fronts. We found little similarity between our December & January first class trips and this one. We’re seriously disappointed, and will be sure to ascertain what type of plane we’ll be flying on and get clear on boarding and offerings. Additionally, as a direct result of our disappointment, we plan to book our next first class trip with either AA or United.

Paid extra for them to change the flights back to the original flights booked, just to have them tell me the departure flight was 'canceled' and they re-booked us for the same flying times, just an entire 24 hours later.

For those interested, I was held at check-in and missed my flight even though I arrived 2 hours early because the check-in person didn't realize I was a Korean citizen and not a foreign traveler. As an aside, Delta's policy for flights to South Korea is ridiculous and doesn't follow the actual government guidelines. Their policy is COVID test results have to be within 72 hours of the departure flight so a test at 8AM on 5/21 would not count for a flight at 10AM on 5/24 even if it is the same 3 days. The Korean government policy is that the 72 hours resets at 12AM every day so it shouldn't matter what the hour of day it is. From the Korean government website: ""The test needs to be issued no more than 72 hours before the departure date. *For example, for travelers whose flight departed on May 10, 2021 at 10:00 a.m., documents issued on or after May 7, 2021 (past 0:00) will be accepted.""

All of this info, even though our email confirmation did not only NOT say that, but said that we should get a 50lb bag for FREE.

So people working for Delta couldn't figure it out every time I talked to someone after arriving to the airport, but it was definitely the customer's fault for not knowing?

I live 20 minutes from the airport and I chose Delta because it was a direct flight. These are difficult to get from Scotland as BA does not route a single flight from Scotland to the USA. You have to go via Heathrow. First May email comes saying not only am I now leaving at 6.00am in the morning instead of 10.30 but from Edinburgh to Amsterdam and then Amsterdam to New York - 15.5 hours. Delta fly daily from Edinburgh to JFK and while I understand they might have cancelled some of them due to Covid I did not expect them to cancel every, single flight. Every, single, day. I was quite surprised because when I tried to book by seats quite few were already taken. So many people have been inconvenienced. I had booked on the premise that if Scotland was shafted yet again as the easy option, they would fly me from another airport, one within the UK. They fly from Heathrow on both Delta operated flights and code share with Virgin too. But they routed me backwards via Amsterdam. Nine hours after I left the house for my 20 minute trip to the airport, I would be back over UK airspace again, right back to where I started.  They would not put me any of the Heathrow flights because they would have to pay BA to fly me there from Edinburgh and they do not code share with them.  They would not give me my money back because I am not American. US law means they have to refund American citizens if they cancel flights with no comparable alternative but as they advised me, they can pretty much do what they want with others. No legal requirement to compensate me or route me even from the same country. I could rebook but they would keep my money until I did. For a year. Then they would keep it all.  So, I had to cancel and rebook from Heathrow and pay the cost of getting myself a return flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow. Apart from the totally inconvenient flight times and flight changes from direct to indirect flights and 2 set sets of immigration to queue up for, I had no wish to have to check if 2 countries still had their borders open to UK citizens until 22nd June. If you live in the EU then Book with European airline in these uncertain times.

"Family Leisure","Economy Class","12-19","no",3,1,2,3,4,5,1," I booked with Delta through hotwire. I had never used Delta before but it was the only airline that didn't have a 6am return flight. I was traveling with my boyfriend and 3 yr old son. First, I booked the flight and car. All the funds were pending. When it actually charged my card, I noticed it was 1 plane ticket less. I thought maybe they changed something due to my son's age, cool. So I questioned whether he would be allowed a carryon or not. The website says its based on price. Seeing as to how I wasn't sure what happened with the ticket prices, I figured I'd call to find out. I spent 9 HOURS to ask this simple question. 5 hours on hold waiting for someone to answer before I gave up, and 4 hours trying to use the online chat. Finally, I got someone, gave them the ticket number (which I figured they would say something if they missed the charge), they said yes to the carry on. Then we get to the airport. We're carrying our bags, a carseat, a stroller and a child. We were rushed through everything as if we were an inconvenience (ok whatever). We get to the gate and wait. Then our flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue with the a/c. For 2+ hours. We missed our connecting flight in Atlanta. At this point I'm stressed, but think ""better safe than sorry, things happen"". Flight back: again, rushed through security. Get to the gate. Wait. Another delay. Mechanical issue with the a/c unit. What are the chances? Again, waiting hours to get on the plane and missing our connecting flight home. Here's the kicker, it was the last flight from Minneapolis to Milwaukee that day so we were not getting home. They searched for options and said we can maybe get you on tomorrow but all of tomorrow's flights are booked up so we'll put you on standby and hopefully you get something. They put us in a hotel in Minneapolis for the night. I had thrown away a bunch of stuff that I didn't think we needed anymore; toothbrushes, toothpaste, trial sizes of deodorant, all of the toiletries. So we had none of that. Ok now we go to the airport again to see if we can get on a plane. They luckily said yes, gave us tickets. We wait. They announce the flight was overbooked and offered $400 for someone to take a later flight. No one took it. Eventually they landed on $600 and someone gave in. $600? I got a $50 hotel room to wait an entire day. Moving on, we go to board and they gave each of us separate seats. I asked if there was a way my 3yr old could sit by either myself or my boyfriend and they said I could figure it out myself. Finally, an attendant on the plane helped me switch seats with another rider so my toddler didn't have to sit with a stranger. We got home and I was just relieved to have it all over with.

I was moving from OKC to Denver, so this was a one way flight. Although there were nonstop flights to Denver I could've taken out of OKC, I chose Delta regardless if I had to take two flights to get to my destination cause they still had social distant seating on all their flights. Which made me feel comfortable since it'd be my first time flying since the pandemic started. Check in at OKC wasn't a hastle. Since I have a Gold Card, they still accepted my bag even though it was a few pounds over the limit. At the gate, I spoke to the agent handling boarding about the precautions. She was very nice and descriptive about their cleanliness and cleaning procedures. She was kind enough to give me a goodie bag filled with cookies, sanitizing wipes and a thank you post card. Flight to SLC from boarding to landing was ontime, smooth and pleasant. Connection at SLC was a little surprising. I learned we'd be deplaning at a remote spot and be bussed to the terminal due to construction I wasn't aware they were doing on some of the terminals. When we deplaned, we had to share two buses with another flight that had just arrived. Both buses ended up being at full capacity. Meaning we weren't able to social distance for the entire bus ride. In this environment, that was dangerous to do. I feel Delta could've done a better job mitigating this issue. Afterwards, the rest of the connection was fine. Boarded, departed and arrived on time. Flight attendants on the flight were nice enough to let me move to an empty row because of my discomfort of sharing a row with another passenger, even though the middle seat was open. Overall, great experience with Delta in a pandemic. If they could just be more cautious about their remote stand connection process, that would be best.

I've been lied to, witnessed a clear violation of how things are supposed to be handled, and I've been ghosted. Some backstory: relocating as a remote worker. I packed my work equipment with multiple layers of bubble wrap and clothing, put them into a box, and sealed it with guerilla tape. I checked my box as an oversized special item to prevent any mishandling. The lady at the counter marked the box as fragile and oversized. She then told me that I could claim the item in a designated area as it would not drop down the conveyor belt. She then asked me to sign away all liability saying that they'll take REASONABLE care of my property but aren't liable for damages. Well, Delta's definition of reasonable care means that they'll stack boxes on top of a box marked fragile, send it over to standard baggage claim tumbling down the conveyor belt, bend the box(how?), Then the coup de grâce, puncture the box and it's content. So I see the box tumbling down the conveyor belt and I'm dmbfounded. This is not what was discussed. Its about to flip over the sides since it tumbled end over end but luckily It caught balance and landed with a thump back onto the belt. I go to the counter to explain to the lady who's clearly annoyed, what happened to my box. She asked me to test if everything in there works. I couldn't find the wires for the monitors and we ended up speaking to LAX. I pointed out every bend and hole on the box saying, this isn't reasonable care. After seeing the box the agent said I can go home to buy wires and test the monitors within 24hrs, email him and then we'll work something out if it's broken. I'm guessing this was to just get me out of the airport because he later ghosted me. The next morning I got some new wires and plugged in my BenQ which worked fine. I then unwrap my dell 27"" ultrasharp ips monitor and see what appears to be a hole that's penetrated the first two layers of the screen. Naive and hopeful, I plug in the monitor thinking that it'll still work and if it's just a scratch then I can live with that. But after plugging it in That scratch started to look more like fractures as the screen begin to illuminate. It was done. I called Delta's help support number, when I finally got through to someone I barely got out half a sentence before being interrupted. The gentleman proceeded to interrupt me a few more times until I finally got my story out and after a final interruption I just hung up. I emailed Scott to update him on the progress I had made, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger to Delta to figure out how to actually put a claim in for the issue. Scott replied back thanking me for keeping him in the loop. I finally got a ticket submitted and within an hour someone had already denied my claim. They offer me $250 travel coupon. I absolutely decline and you can remove it from my account then remove my account. I send another message to the agent , he was friendly so I'm sure he'd be willing to help, nope. He ghosted me. I've made quite a few trips with Delta in the past for work and I religiously chose them because of their seating space and how easy it is to check in. No more. I'd rather fly Spirit. You all really showed how much you value the 9-5 regular Joe. I bet if I was a frequent first class passenger",2.71428571428571,"Trip Verified","Dallas Ft Worth","Atlanta"

My son and I were very frustrated and helpless. At this time, a person in charge of Delta Air Lines helped us in time. She is a warm and kind angel. Her name is Kayleigh. I would like to thank her for helping us book a return flight ticket and at the same time keeping the flight ticket that we can change the international flight time at any time, so that my son and I no longer feel helpless and afraid.

My wife had purchased a ticket for me to meet them in Washington for a spring break trip. Due to the Virus outbreak it was not a good idea to go forward with that trip rather than refund us during a worldwide pandemic they had to make sure they kept our money ""graciously"" offering us a future credit. When it came time that we felt we could use the credit they had a policy in place saying they couldn't change the name attached to the ticket. My wife (who originally purchased the ticket) was going to use the credit instead of me. They would not allow the change even though it was the same family, trip, customer, and even credit card. It's sad when a company clearly only cares about the money and in no means the customer. You would hope that eventually no one would continue to support businesses like this that take advantage of people during hard times or any time for that matter. If you were paid then you were paid. It shouldn't make a difference who uses the ticket if the purchaser wants to transfer it. Please don't support this company's future.

On May 23rd, I get an email that there had been some changes to my flight and that’s when I noticed they had me leaving at 123PM and arriving at 628PM is MSP, then to ATL and finally to my destination in ICT. The thing is, my connection flight at MSP was supposed to be at 9AM that same day. Unless the airline is on to something that I’m not aware about, that connection isn’t possible. I called the travel agency I booked my ticket through and the only way to fix this flight was to change the PDX to MSP flight to June 4th, same flight, same times just a day earlier with a 14 hour layover. I bit the bullet and said sure, go ahead and do that. I wake up, May 25th and Delta went ahead and changed my flight back to the original of my flight(s) all being on the same day. AGAIN, last time I checked that’s an impossible flight to make my connection. Called Delta, in attempt to fix something that I had already fixed the day prior and was put on hold for 3.5 hours to only have the call disconnected half way through. Called back and again, 3.5 hours and got “hung up” on. Gave up and went back to communicating through the travel agency. They then informed me, the MSP to ATL flight no longer exists and there was no way for me to make my flight unless I was willing to pay the difference for another flight. I told them to cancel my booking, because I didn’t want this to happen again, once I booked another flight through Delta. Ended up booking a flight through American for the one way ticket that was double the price I had paid, for the original round trip ticket! Never again will I fly with this airline.

"Family Leisure","Premium Economy","09-19","no",2,3,4,5,1,1,1," Delta would not guarantee an empty seat beside me when I first booked first class. So I changed to a comfort seat with the middle row left empty. But the three other people in the same row had no masks. I asked the steward to get me a different seat but she said there is nothing she could do. Then the man who sat on the aisle closest to my window seat said he would wear a mask for me. Conclusion is that Delta emails you ahead of time stating they require masks. They reiterate this at the gate. They even offer masks if you don't have one. But a few people just refuse and can put an older woman with asthma, like me, at risk. If they are not asked to leave, as Delta says they will do, this will continue. In addition, Delta does not show all the selected seats on the seating selection chart, which misleads one regarding the number of people in your cabin. Imagine my shock when I was assured by the booking agent that the next two seats would be empty when only the middle seat was and the other three seats were filled with people without a mask.",2.42857142857143,"Trip Verified","Beijing","Seattle"

Transferred me, spent another hour on hold, finally got a guy and in the middle of our conversation we got cut off. Got a confirmation email from Delta, but when I tried to pay for the ticket online it could not find the reservation. Called Delta again, again on hold for well over an hour. When I did get through I was told that the ticket price was no longer what I was quoted but had increased to $811.00. I was well within the grace period for purchasing the ticket. I was not told by the first agent that the price was subject to an increase. Talked to a supervisor who said there was nothing he could do, so I paid the difference. This is bait and switch.

I spoke with a Delta customer service representative on 5 March 2020 and requested a full refund. The customer service representative consulted with a supervisor and agreed to give me a full refund without penalties as this was a COVID-19 related situation. As of 4/28/20 I have not received a refund. After spending much time in a call queue, a representative informed me that a refund would not be coming and I would only receive a voucher with time limitations, despite being told that I would receive a full refund in March. I was then transferred to another customer service representative who would only repeat the same lines over and over again. The representative refused to provide me with a transcript of my previous call, refused to transfer me to another person to provide assistance, and was incredibly rude and condescending. He would not send me anything in writing, stating a policy that he couldn’t provide me with either. The representative acknowledged that I was told to expect a refund and then told me that I would never get a refund and that no one in Delta could help me. He then hung up on me after I again asked to speak with someone who could help me. Delta is refusing to honor a refund that was already promised by a Delta employee who was authorized to promise a refund. Delta's customer service is extremely offensive. It is very clear that their only role is to stonewall customers in hopes that they give up and go away.

I wanted to take this time to highlight the good. On March 13th I was in Miami and the corona-virus was becoming a huge issue and my mom thought it would be a good idea that I flew home and I too thought it would be a good idea so I proceeded to book my flight to leave the following morning. When I booked the flight I thought I put insurance on the ticket turns out I did not. The next morning came and unfortunately I missed my flight I was a bit upset but not surprised because I honestly was not prepared. Knowing that I had not put insurance on the ticket I was upset that I would now be out of $130. With everything going on, money no matter the amount, is very much needed for rainy days but I knew that my own irresponsibility had put me in this position so I just let the situation go. So fast forward to today, March 31st, I had got paid and when I went to go check my account there was an extra $130 in my account. Of course at this point I had forgotten all about the ticket and I had already knew I didn't buy the ticket insurance so I was not at all expecting any type of refund. So I went in my payment history to see where the money had come from and sure enough it said ""Delta Airlines"". That's the difference between a good company and a GREAT company. I just wanted to say I truly appreciate the Delta community because they did not at all have to do that, but they did! And as I stated before people tend to shed light on all of the bad things before they sit and appreciate the good and that honestly made my day!

With customer service phone-lines bogged up because of the crisis, we decided to take our chances and head to the airport a day early to see if there was any chance we could return sooner. Luckily, we were met with Dionne at the Delta Check-In (Terminal 2, at LaGuardia airport). Dionne had to deal with a faulty system that forced her to enter our passport credentials manually, but she handled it with grace and humour (which was really needed at that moment). She also did everything she could to find all the options available to us. Thankfully, she was able to get us on a flight later that day, direct to Toronto.

The connecting flight from Minneapolis to Fargo was on a smaller plane and there was no inflight service. Again, there were empty seats which made boarding and disembarking quick and no hassles with stashing the oversized winter jackets we have on at this time of the year in that part of the country.

What is not forgivable is the lies I was told by numerous Delta representatives nearly every day. I was told that my luggage had been recovered the day after it went missing. The automated message assured me that my property would be on its way to me later that day or the day after. This went on every day of my Christmas holiday until the bag arrived the day after I left. I spent hours on the phone waiting for answers and was told that I would not be charged for the bill. I eventually received a massive bill that Delta refused to reimburse me for. They awarded me credit vouchers to the value of half of my phone bill. My bag was missing for one month despite me knowing its exact location every day of its misplacement. I asked Delta many times to let me take care of recovering it but they refused and promised to take care of as soon as possible. Whether pure incompetence, dishonesty or carelessness, I cannot forgive Delta for ruining my Christmas holidays.

"Solo Leisure","Economy Class","08-19","no",1,1,1,1,1,1,1," New York to Dallas Ft Worth. When it comes to choosing an airline, I am sure many would agree with me that the biggest factor in this decision is trust. Trusting the airline to get you to your destination safely. Trusting them to take care of your luggage. Trusting them to provide you with accurate information with anything regarding your travels. I have trusted Delta Airlines for a very long time. I am even a Delta SkyMiles member, as I had planned on being a customer of theirs for a very long time. But I am afraid to say that that trust has reached its demise after today. Today, I flew to Dallas for a business trip that included a golf outing. I was particularly excited about this golf outing, as I had just bought a brand new $300 club that I was very eager to try. However, the club did not come in the mail before I had to ship the rest of my clubs out via a 3rd party service. I immediately called Delta to see if bringing a single golf club onto the plane was possible. I was very doubtful that this would be allowed, but I thought it would be worth making a phone call just to make sure. When I called Delta’s baggage support line, the man who answered the phone told me in complete confidence that it would not be an issue. I even made sure to ask if I would have any trouble getting it through security. He assured me that it would be fine and that I could store the club in the planes closet or just hold it with me in my seat. This information made me very happy and reinforced the high quality of service and excellence that I believed Delta Airlines provided to all their passengers. When I arrived at the airport, I went to check in a bag. While I was at the counter, 3 women were standing there as one of them was checking in my bag. Not one of them noticed the golf club I was carrying and recommended that I checked it in. But why would they? They were probably just as clueless of the rules and regulations as the man I spoke with on the phone. I got to the front of security with 30 minutes until my flight was supposed to leave when one of the officers told me that I was not allowed to bring my club through. I assured him that I spoke with Delta and they said it was ok. It turns out that all sporting equipment must be checked in, no matter how small it may be. I sprinted back to the check in desk to try and check the club in, but it was too late to do so. I even tried to go store it, but the crew was switching shifts and would not be open for another 15 minutes. I did not have 15 minutes. Long story short, I was forced to throw away a brand new $300 golf club because of the false information that I was provided by Deltas clueless support team and the lack of awareness of their check-in team.  It is safe to say that I will never be flying Delta again and I hope that my story will show others that Delta cannot be trusted.",1,"Trip Verified","Spokane","Fresno"

We were actually allowed 1 free checked bag per person allowing us to put all of our baggage into the hold and simply ignore the overhead bins. We actually departed five minutes ahead of schedule as the boarding process went very smoothly. This was the first time I ever had a flight depart ahead of schedule and I have to say it worked out very well. The seating was amazing and the seats all had massive padded headrests which were also adjustable, something very rare on such a small narrowbody aircraft. The food was also amazing and Delta have a wide variety of complimentary snacks and beverages, but I also got their protein box -s easily worth the $9 I paid for it. The only thing holding this back from a 10/10 was that the in-flight entertainment system on my plane wasn't working, but an issue like this is quite rare. We just got unlucky, but I didn't mind it all that much as I slept for most of the flight. Overall, this flight was well worth waking up at 2:30 A.M, as this was easily the best domestic flight I have ever flown on (even with the nonfunctional IFE.)",1.85714285714286,"Trip Verified","Detroit","St Louis"

Instead of Delta making an exception for the 5 minutes we were late to check in our bags (apparently you have to arrive no later than 45 minutes before the departure time), they told me there was nothing they could do and that if I wanted to transfer my ticket, it was going to cost $618 per person (x3), or I could just buy three new tickets for the next flight (4 hours later) for $488 per person,  which included my significant other and my 4 year old.  Delta made ZERO attempt to assist my family in getting home, getting our bags to the plane, or even the next flight would have been fine, and gave us a choice: You either cough up at least $1,500 or we are out of luck.

Based on my experience DL has the best long haul economy service that no other carrier I have ever used could beat (LH, OS, EK, KL, QR, HU). The reasons are the next: 1) A330s and 767s: 2-whatever-2 layout is much more traveller friendly than 3-whatever-3 (worst experience is KL’s 787). 2) stable wifi: Gogo did a great job. This time there was some short connectivity issue over the Canadian permafrost 3) clean cabin: I don’t know why this is a big challenge for others, but if you collect garbage frequently, then the cabin will stay clean 4) surprisingly good food and beverages: first time in my life I liked airline meal. SweetWater ale is also a big plus. Delta might do a decent job only on the Seattle routs but they do a really great job there.

"Family Leisure","Economy Class","08-19","no",3,1,2,1,2,1,1," I had a flight from Cancun to Pittsburgh connecting through Atlanta yesterday. On my first flight, a cup of coffee was spilled on my lap after the passenger sitting next to me was bumped by the flight attendant and spilled her coffee. I accept accidents happen and I managed as best I could despite being wet and sticky. I shrugged this off and hurried to immigration/ customs. I have global entry and only had carry-on luggage and saw that there was a 2 hour earlier flight on Delta (15699) that would allow me to get home sooner, out of my sticky clothes and permit me to surprise my 8 year old son by getting to his swim competition in time. From online, it appeared there were over 20 seats open in the main cabin. I stopped at the delta baggage desk right after Customs and asked if this was possible and they said yes but that I had to run up to the gate since it was already boarding. I did just that- I ran! I got myself from the F concourse to the B concourse, Gate 5 and the area was clear, the gate was open for another 5 minutes and was staffed by an agent. I had to rest for 30 seconds just to catch my breath. I explained the agent what the Delta agents had told me to do. His response- was flat and dismissive ""Are you a Delta Platinum member?"" ""Are you A Delta Gold Member?"" I said no to both queries. His next response ""Well then you will have to pay $75 for a ticket change."" I explained that the representatives had indicated this would not be a problem as there were so many seats open- I was already travelling on Delta and normally this flight would not be available to me book as the time between flights is too small to be permitted to book during the initial reservation. I explained how my clothes were now sticky as a result of the coffee being spilled on me. I explained about my 8 year old and wanting to get home. None of this mattered. I was nobody to the agent. My impression after this - Delta only cares about you if you are a Platinum or Gold member. (Ironically I had considered, an hour earlier while in flight, applying for the platinum card as my husband sits on the American Board of Plastic Surgeons and flies often for board meetings. Suffice to say- I will stick with my existing airline credit cards and skip Delta's card as I do not see myself electively travelling on Delta in the future). I begged the agent to call a supervisor - he did but he dawdled and the gate was just 2 minutes from closing. I watched painfully as the door closed and the plane took off and the agent didn't care. There was no empathy, no compassion. Nothing.  I couldn't believe that this Delta agent would let me stand there, bag in hand, knowing he could have been kind and allowed me to see my family earlier, see my son compete and offset my unfortunate 'coffee in the lap' experience. I couldn't believe that he let me sit there knowing how many seats were empty on that flight just to make a point -pay the $75 or wait without reason. The irony is that my scheduled delta flight, 2 hours later, was so full that they had customers waiting in standby. That agent could have freed up my seat if he had let me get on the earlier flight. Poor service all the way around. I will avoid Delta whenever possible.",1.57142857142857,"Trip Verified","New York JFK","Vancouver"

But I'm starting to notice that their service is becoming as second rate as other airlines. I was recently flying home on Christmas Eve and was so early to the gate that me and my colleague decided to grab a quick bite very close by. As we sat there and eventually watched other passengers board, we finished our meal and headed back over to the gate. When we got there they informed us they had given our seats away. No intercom, no warning, nothing -- just oversold and a whole bunch of people trying to get to their families in time for Christmas. So they bumped us. The next two flights were also oversold and so we had to buy two new tickets to get home late that night. It took us 9 extra hours to get home and had to fly through Seattle instead of on the direct flight we had seats for. We got to SLC late and many passengers were trying to get to connecting flights. One woman, in particular, had a young sleepy girl and was carrying large bags. She had only a few minutes to get to her gate and was going to miss her flight. We picked up her bags and sprinted no less than a half mile to the other terminal and caught them as they were closing the doors. We told her a woman was coming with her baby and to please hold the flight. It was an honor to get this poor woman and her child on her flight and we saved Delta from her missing her plane on Christmas Eve. That would have been 100% their fault. Now - I just spent 2 hours on the phone hoping Delta would show us a courtsey of some kind of credit for having to spend an extra $750 on new tickets to get home. Their customer service talked over me, did not employ good English, was disrespectful and told me it was all my fault. Even if that's true - why would you not do all you can to save a customer or to take care of a customer who has been so loyal? Why be just like so many other airlines?

But I recall that I was not given a complimentary even once last year.

About 6 days before the flight, my app showed no seats available in first, even for dollars or miles.

We had 3 minors traveling with us, the youngest was 11 and was nervous about flying. We did not pay the extra fee to choose our seats because we has flown other times on other airlines and never had to pay to be seated together. We really do not have a preference where on the plane we sit as long as we are seated together. This has been the first time ever that all of us were seated in completely different rows throughout the plane. All of us got middle seats between 2 strangers. I was very upset that my kids had to fly alone and sit between 2 strangers. I asked the flight attendant to please help me find someone to switch seats so that at least my youngest son would not have to be alone. She offered to come see me once we were on the plane and try to help me but no one ever came to me. I asked the person next to me who was an adult flying alone if she would switch with my son and she refused to. It is very upsetting to know that this airline only cares about making extra money on allowing people to pay for choosing their seats even if it means splitting up children from their families.  I kept thinking what if those adults are watching or saying something inappropriate next to my child, or something even worse. Also, if it had been a flight with turbulence, he would've been very nervous alone. Flying can be scary even for many adults. After this experience, I will definitely never fly Delta again which is a shame because they do have comfortable seats and offer snacks and drinks which many other airlines do not. They also have movies to choose from which help the flights go by faster. I have flown with my family many times and have never had this happen. It really should not be allowed.

The door to my seat got stuck where I had to jam it open. And the charger worked intermittently throughout the flight. And I was told it was a brand new plane.

I had originally paid $703 to upgrade to Premium select until my first flight so I upgraded to Delta One for $1,532. After my flight I requested to be refunded for my upgrade. I was told they would refund my ticket upgrade and would give me $724. I told them that was not my upgrade amount. Then they wrote me back and said that was half of the amount for the upgrade.

Most times it seems like the gate does manage to rearrange seats, but it’s an unnecessary stress/step. It feels like they separate basic economy passengers so (a) they pay to get seats together, or (b) Delta looks good by getting them back together. I guess after traveling for a few decades, I came to expect sitting next to my wife as a basic requirement of service, so the entire extent of any negativity in this review should be attributed to my discontent over the shift away from that strategy.

I payed a lot of money because this was a last min trip. I was traveling with my 4 month old baby girl. I had to change her diaper asap. I was closer to the front and they were giving out snacks and drinks at the back so I could not really go through to the back. So when I was heading to the front bathroom, the male flight attendant told we to wait aside (with his hand) so I waited, one person came out the bathroom, as soon as that happens another person from first class goes in and he sees her. She comes out, a second person gets up and goes into the bathroom, ( I can’t get to the bathroom fast enough as he made me wait behind the first class section) then a third first class person goes in front of me. At that point I’m getting upset because this flight attendant knows I’ve been waiting there - then I ask if the changing table is located in side the bathroom, I’ve never changed a diaper in an airplane before so I don’t know. He replies by telling me “I suppose“ But because I’m not first class he doesn’t nothing to help, and he was Very nice to the first class so I can see he’s got potential to be nice to me as well if I would of paid extra for first class. I finally was able to get to the bathroom to change my baby. 2 hrs later, I had to use the restroom. Again, I have to go to the front. Then I ask him if it’s being used. He reply’s with “I don’t know, what do you see the sign say”? With a very rude attitude. He was just over all a very rude flight attendant. I’ve been in many many flights and I’ve never been treated like a peasant. I guess I can expect this from spirit, frontier , or American, but Not United.

Back at the counter we were told that boarding had been closed and that it was impossible for us to get on that plane. And then the miracle happened: the agent organized everything for us. She put us on the same flight 24 hours later, booked a hotel room for us, breakfast, taxi - all we needed. And it didn´t cost us a dollar. All this was paid for by Delta.

We were positively shocked to receive a welcoming cocktail - in basic economy - and one of our favorite cocktails, peach Bellini. The cabin crew ran rounds with water and soft drinks, and also several rounds with hot drinks and alcohol. The wine is not bad at all. They give hot towels before meals. Food has been improved, too, and the white grape, cheese and toasted almond snack was delish, as was the salted caramel ice cream. The pizza twist served as a second snack was underwhelming, however, but pizza is not my favorite anyway. Nothing to object to cabin crew or pilots, they are up to the task, as they always have been, but the service and the little things that make up the 9 hours on the plane bearable, are much better. The flight was super smooth and we touched down on time.

Though I have tried to reconcile these issues with the company and have been gifted several vouchers (which i have not used) it seems that the issues mentioned do not get corrected. My last flight was Nov. 10, 2019 flying home from spending my birthday with friends and family. the flight was set to board at 7:35pm and depart at 8:15pm. At the gate it was announced that the airline was awaiting the arrival of the captain and co-captain to arrive and boarding was pushed back 20-30 minutes. This is understandable ... boarding started at or around 8:10pm whereas it was around 8:30 by the time Main Cabin 1 was called to board. Around 20 minutes after sitting in my seat the flight attendants cam over the PA stating that they had no update on the whereabouts of the captain and co- captain and thanked everyone for their patience (8:50pm). 20 minutes later the Captain announced his sincerest apologies and explained he had just flown in with the NFL team and had been stranded on the tarmac for some time before catching a ride over to our plane (9:10pm). He added that checks still had to be made prior to the flight and we should be taking off in around 25-30 minutes. At 9:34 pm we pushed away from the gate prepared for take off and that the flight would take two hours and fourteen minutes from take off to touch down, then another delay as we were declared number 3 for take off.

The same was true to other passengers who experienced the same problem on the same flight when in Singapore from the US via Tokyo. After filing complaint to the customer service, the customer service took more than 14 days to reply (when in their auto reply email stated they would reply within 14 days) and the customer service would defend their mistakes and continue laying blame on the passengers. I have been their top level frequent fliers but I never felt I was treated like one at all. They don't offer any preferential check in, retrieval of luggage bags above their usual sky priority which a simple comfort + would earn the similar treatment while being the top frequent fliers on other alliance group or airlines would have offered 1st class service than Delta offering merely the same like comfort +. Service recovery is bad. The staff are not trained or geared towards high value customers at all. Having a Porsche for tight connection is nothing premium when other airlines offer direct boarding from lounge like Emirates or complimentary limousine airport transfers such as from JL, MH and so on. They appear to prefer paid business class passengers but their products and services completely do NOT match up to any full service airlines that have business class product. Their lounge is always filled with so many people and refreshment are really just plain refreshment (basic snacks NOT food) and very often, their lounges do NOT even have shower facilities. So don't even count on having complimentary spa/massage/sleeping area etc. Their planes are dirty and old yet the ticket fares are expensive. Amenities frequently not working for example IFE doesn't work, USB not charging, food stuck in between seats, chewing gums found in aircraft safety menu, dirty toilets, broken window shades and Delta has a policy where instead of bumping revenue passengers to higher classes when seats are needed, they would instead bump their non revenue employees or families/kins onto business class seats especially on international route. Their complimentary first class upgrade almost hardly happen to any members as it will always be full. Delta will always try not to offer the upgrade until at boarding and by which time, all the first class seats would be taken up already. So don't be fooled by the benefits stated on their website for their frequent fliers programme. Their hidden clause to defend their misrepresentation would be ""whenever available"". To Delta, available for revenue tickets doesn't mean available for upgrade. There is absolutely no incentives being their frequent fliers especially for international travellers. They are just a commuter airline within US or regional at best. So Delta best if ever rated best is best within the US only. In one word to describe Delta and by International Standard, avoid  it.

Not a real option as the rest of the trip had already been booked and partially paid for. Arriving at the check-in counter at Amsterdam Airport we got different seats than booked. Explanation: Delta had flown in with a different aircraft. But we were assured that we would nonetheless have Comfort Plus seats being ‘the equivalent of Premium Select’. This is, of course, not the case: The difference between Comfort Plus and Premium Select is 4 inches of legroom less, no leg support and no 7 degrees more reclining seats; a smaller screen and no personalized service etc. Features reflected in the price difference. The big blow, however, came inside the plane. One can try to call any seat a Comfort Plus seat, but not a main cabin seat with 9 instead of 8 abreast. Also, dinner came on the same tray and with the same quality as the rest of the cabin, The menu circulated in advance was clearly marked ‘International Main Cabin’. Checking the safety instructions in the seat pocket, it turned out that the plane in question was a Boeing 777-200 in a configuration not available on Delta’s web site. Probably an older version, because my table was hanging toward me, making my food tray almost landing on my lap. What I reproach Delta most of all is that they were not straightforward.

I used the certificates to purchase first class seats for my travel dates. Then on the day of my Christmas travel I printed out my first-class tickets and boarding passes for the trip. I reached out to Delta to confirm my seats. At that point I was told that I needed one more pass to have first class seats for my round trip travel. I was told the young lady that I purchased the tickets in June and I have my tickets showing my travel in first class and my seat assignments for the round trip.

Once we landed at Kahului, HI airport we sat on the tarmac for two hours before pulling up to the gate to unload.

In summer of 2022 I was booking flights back from Europe for my family and they double charged me for same flights and took them 3 weeks to refund the money. In December they canceled our flights to Colorado last-minute two days in a row, and would not rebook us until well half way into our vacation. Insultingly they tried to offer us a layover flight in Los Angeles, on day 4 and even that without a guarantee that would make our direct flight I paid more for, an 8 hour travel. We spent two days including Christmas Eve trying to get a resolution with customer service (if you can call it that). We lost all the money we paid for our stay in Colorado, and ended up staying in Atlanta for the holidays with no plans, and no vacation days left. My emotions aside, this company simply does not feel the need to care for their passengers. Our well being and experience simply takes the backseat, and their frontline people hide behind the process and simply shrug it off. We are simply cargo to them, and cargo can be shuffled around and delayed with no consequences. They surely do not live up to their tone-deaf advertisements they make us watch prior to takeoff. What grinds my gears even more is that they will make you move a pound of language from one bag and right into another because of 'weight limit'. Defies all logic. All bags - by weight and volume still ends up on the same plane. Why would a company have processes in place to add to the passenger frustration, and intentionally not do anything about it. They fully capable to provide everyone care, but they make conscious effort to not do that. They ask us to complete surveys, and I'm sure they get plenty of feedback like this, but they simply chose to not do anything about it. What a shame.",1.57142857142857,"Not Verified","Rome","Atlanta"

I’m assuming the people on the grounds are also working as hard as they can. But you as a company suck. You have over-extended yourself and make promises to customers that you never follow through with and you believe that your vouchers and your credits will make it better. I don’t travel a ton. In fact, maybe once a year, but I am seasoned. I have never flown Delta until this time to Hawaii from Denver. I have never been so disappointed in my life. Delta behaved like it never knew any type of weather existed or knowledge of the workings of an airport. I understand there are always going to be limitations. I have been through delays but nothing like this. My first delay from this trip was due to weather from another city - fine. But it was delayed even further because when we were got to Seattle, there wasn’t a loading bridge that could unload us from the airplane - it was coming from the S gate to the A gate and the pilot didn’t know why. We missed our flight to Hawaii by 10 minutes and couldn’t get one until the next day. If you don’t have the workers/materials or have the workings of the flight even if delayed planned out, don’t make these promises that you can get us there. Do your due diligence and make sure things are running smoothly at the airports you do business at. The next day when we flew out of Seattle to Hawaii - they had to taxi us back due to mechanical issues. After about 45 minutes, I thanked the mechanics after they departed and we were off. Better safe than sorry for this delay. And now that I’m thinking about it, this was Hawaiian airlines. I do have to say when we did land in Hawaii that day, the luggage people at Delta went way beyond my expectations! It was waiting at their customer service office. Coming home from the LA airport was also a terrible experience. We were of course delayed (no reason given) which was fine but when we were all boarded, we were having issues with the push off tug and we were delayed another hour because we had to wait for another one then when we finally made it to Denver at around 11:30, we had to sit on the plane for two hours with really no true explanation as to why. There were two planes that passed us by & they both went to their unloading gate. I understand weather, I understand shortages of workers but Delta acted as if does not. Don’t offer flights if you can’t follow through to just attempt to get us to the gate in a timely manner. Again the employees were top notch except for your customer service via chat - they couldn’t do nearly as much as when we waited in line for two hours to talk to a human which I’ll never understand why either - my questions were the same.

When I saw the Delta representative arrive to the gate I approached the counter said Good morning and asked how she was doing? Delta CSR response - what do you need, I explained that I needed my seat selected and asked if I could have one of the comfort seats. She stated no and continued to look at the monitor about 15 seconds of silence passed before I asked if there was a reason why. She stated in a very negative tone while rolling her eyes you purchased coach so you don't get to upgrade for free. I tried to explain it would not give me the option to upgrade to comfort because only available seats were blocked by the airline, I told Delta's CSR she could see that I did purchase comfort on my connecting flight. I asked could I pay the difference for the comfort seat. She stated you would need to repurchase a whole new ticket and I would not be reimbursed for the existing one. I then asked may I have row 36 seat C, she never responded never looked up just continued as if I never asked a question but took several deep breaths every few seconds. Again another 15-20 seconds of silence then she says I'm printing your new ticket. Delta's CSR decided to select a different seat with no explanation, she handed me the ticket and said next.

About 50 minutes into the flight you could choose from a cheese plate or chicken salad sandwich along with beer, wine or non-alcoholic drinks. I was offered an extra meal since I asked for one which was good. Inflight entertainment was excellent. The only bad thing was the tray table was broken on my seat.

Though I had access to the ""priority line"", I skipped the lounge and went straight to the Amex Lounge. The main purpose of a lounge is to provide a nice space to relax before a flight. What is the point to get to a lounge that is ""at capacity""? With all the news I heard recently, this seems to be a chronic issue rather than an unexpected situation. Delta did not do any upgrade on its A330-200, meaning the Delta One seat was very old. It was relatively comfortable, but it was worn out with virtually no storage space. I think the most basic part of a business class flat bed seat is a small, secured storage space so passengers can put away small items like eye glasses, wallets and phones while sleeping. On the good side, staff are courteous and accommodating, and I can see a significant improvement in meal quality. They also provided slippers, which was a nice touch.

Anyway, sitting together, at the exact same time, side by side, we go and change our flights. I was pleasantly surprised as I received a $50 credit by making the change. However, my husband's change errored out. Apparently he had to pay MORE miles to move the day, for the exact same change I received credit for. The explanation was that prices are subject to change at any time, but since it was the same time it made no sense. So anyway, I can't help but believe they gouge prices when redeeming miles. There is no other reason mine would have resulted in a credit. And his required an additonal 6000 miles. We had issues with our Hawaii trip as well.

We were flying from Atlanta-GA to New York, then Tel Aviv - Israel. A trip that I had been doing for years with different Airlines. On December, 18th 2021, I got to the Airport 3 hours before the flight, as they requested, but the check-in line was moving extremely slowly. After about 1 hour and a half, I asked an employee to please help us make it in time for our flight. He assured me that we had enough time. Another half hour went by and I saw this person again. I went towards him and said I had one more hour to my flight with my kids and there were still a lot of people in front of me. Again, he was dismissive and said we would be able to make it on time. We finally made it to the check-in desk, got our boarding passes to the NY flight and the connecting flight to Israel and ran to security. I took it upon myself and apologized to all the people we were passing to get through security and get to our gate. Just as we got to the gate, the plane was already moving. We got there late. I was livid and I made it very clear that I was angry. The problem was that they knew we were on our way. We had already checked in, our names were on the list with assigned seats, and we had the boarding passes in our hands. I’m willing to bet that due to extremely bad management, they overbooked the plane; that is why they quickly closed the door and allowed the plane to take off. Eventually, a Delta Employee was able to put my kids and I on another flight to NY.  When we got to the gate, they had just closed it and refused to reopen it. I said to the employee “You knew we were on our way, our names were on the list. Why didn’t you wait for just 2 minutes? She did not answer, but again it’s obvious that they overbooked the plane. By now, I was going to miss our flight to Israel as well. I don’t think there was anyone on that terminal that did not hear my voice when I was yelling and screaming off the top of my lungs that Delta and its management are nothing but screw-ups and they don't care about their clients At this point someone came and told me she could help and would make sure that I would be on the next flight. However, we were going to miss the flight to Israel but there would be another flight in the evening that we would have to wait for (if I’m not mistaken about 6 hours). I did not care. I asked her to do whatever needed to be done. She started transferring our boarding passes from the flights we lost to the new flight to NY and the flight to Israel that same evening. However, she was only able to issue my and two of my kids boarding passes, but was having a problem getting the boarding pass for my other son. Time was getting very close to the flight going to NY, so she asked me to leave and in NY they would get him the boarding pass. When we got to NY, the first thing I wanted to do was to get my son his boarding pass. I went immediately to the Delta desk; the person there was taking forever, then someone else came in and started asking my son for his permit to travel and his Covid test. I told them that we had already been through this and he already had a boarding pass, but because of Delta’s poor management and flawed service, we lost 3 flights. All they needed to do was transfer his boarding pass to the next flight. However, this process was also taking long. They kept on asking him unnecessary questions and he was only 15.

I applied for a refund of the cost of my Delta ticket, which finally was paid over a month later. I also applied for compensation for the fare difference caused by Delta's cancellation (just under $400). Today, over three months later, my request was refused. I was given a ""sorry"" flight credit coupon for $50. It will go unused, as I will never fly Delta again.

"Couple Leisure","Economy Class","10-18","no",1,1,1,1,1,1,1," I booked a flight from LGA to Cleveland so that I could attend a wedding. I was a groomsman for the wedding and was looking forward to participating in all of the events. I found some flights that worked for my schedule and they happened to be Delta whom I do not typically choose as travel partners. I had coordinated plans with people based on my itinerary but unfortunately found out, that when flying with Delta, a set schedule is always subject to change and your efforts to be a dependable person in regard to your commitment is jeopardized with their great ineptitude of being a reliable transportation service. It might be easiest to understand my disappointment and frustration by simply looking at the attachments of the update texts. From all of my other travel experiences, which I am fortunate and grateful to say is plenty and well above average, I usually receive 1-2 update texts mostly with confirmations of flight and gate information. Delta operates differently than their competitors however as they like to send 10-12 texts with new gate information and change of departure times. For those who like spontaneous adventures, simply book a flight with Delta and you'll be running around the airport all day with changes of departure times every 30-45 minutes! Unfortunately due to all of this irresponsible and unreliable service from Delta, I held many people up and changed a lot of people's schedules simply bc I didn't know when I was going to get in. Eventually plans were canceled and I, with the help of Delta Airlines, ruined a night of fun which was planned a long time in advance. I will say that Delta is consistent in that the return flight was just as bad. I was supposed to take off at 12:15pm and it's currently 5:15pm and our flight has now been pushed back until 7:10pm. Believe me, I'm not holding my breath! In summary though, Delta has proven to me that it is a completely unreliable travel service with little to no regard nor respect for it's customer's time nor plans. If you are someone that would like to pay the same amount of money as their competitors but have no security in when your flight will actually take off, Delta airlines is your best bet. If you purchase flights with a purpose and make plans around the set schedule the airline commits to, then you should be sure to filter out Delta in your search.",1,"Trip Verified","Paris","New York"

No serious complaints for an airline with which I have rarely had negative experiences over the years - from the perspective of being an actual customer of the airline. However, I have a few suggestions for some of their hubs: they could stand to work with the Atlanta airport authority to modernize ATL and enforce standards of cleanliness, to update the airport from 1999 to the modern era and to make it a truly world-class airport rather than the busiest. Delta has the onus since Atlanta is their headquarters and primary global hub, and nearly 75% of all passengers arriving into and departing from Atlanta are using Delta. Delta should also work with the Seattle airport authority for the same thing.

I sat in the concourse nearby to see if it was happening to others and counted 12 other passengers who entered, and came back out looking embarrassed and/or angry.

At one point I got a person who was nice but she went off shift before anything resolved. Going in circles. Finally gave it up as an impossible quest. At one point was told all I could do was file a complaint as I did not report it at the airport - at 2am. My time is worth more than this or the suitcase, which was not even new and for which I would have settled for maybe $75. Left a very bad taste. Especially since I was on vacation.

"Solo Leisure","First Class","08-18","no",5,1,2,3,4,5,1," I have never experienced such absolutely appalling, rude, and condescending customer service in my life as I did at the counter in Midway. Short, snippy, and sarcastic, the agent seemed to want to have very little to do with us from the minute we stepped to the counter. No smile, no hello, no greeting. And it was all downhill from there. We had been planning for my son to participate in a foreign exchange program for a year and a half. Made all the arrangements, did all the research, and checked all the boxes. We chose Delta because they had an arrival time inside of a time window we needed to meet. Simple enough. He is a minor. He is old enough to opt out of the Delta Unaccompanied Minor program, where they charge an extra $150 and require someone at the destination to jump through a bunch of hoops to pick him up. The host organization already had a process in place. We researched the unaccompanied minor rules and regulations. The host organization would have someone waiting to meet with him at the gate in Japan. No problem. We chose to opt out of the unaccompanied minor program because the Delta website rules specifically state: https://www.delta.com/us/en/children-infant-travel/unaccompanied-minor-program ""If I decline the Unaccompanied Minor Service for my 15-17 year old, can I still accompany them to the gate? Yes. If you are dropping off or picking up your minor but opted out of the Unaccompanied Minor program, we will issue you a pass to accompany your child to the gate. Please check with an airport agent at the time of check-in to have the gate pass issued."" We arrive at the ticket counter to begin the process and the agent is visibly annoyed that she now has to go through all of this process first thing in the morning (visa, passport, covid test verification, etc) and she makes it very clear through her body language and attitude that she is annoyed. Then we get to the part where I request a pass to accompany my son to his gate. She responds ""No. He's old enough to travel by himself."" I mention the rules we had researched, and after some tense back and forth, she says ""no, we're not Southwest."" Now, tensions are escalating and my son is upset. She even walks away at one point to go do something else that seemed completely unrelated to us. I know if I escalate any further, I run the risk of expulsion from the airport, so we take our boarding pass and move away. My son is very upset at this point and asks if there is anything else we can do. We get back in line to try a different agent. This one is even worse. I opened the discussion with a recap of our previous encounter and even showed her the Delta website I had pulled up on my phone. She looks right at it and says the only thing she can do is enroll him in the unaccompanied minor program. So I say, ""ok, let's do that."" She rolls her eyes and her shoulders slump. She leans forward, places her hands face down on the counter looks up with her head cocked to the side and says ""fine. But I'm going to need a lot of information."" She has us fill out a form which is quite comprehensive, then starts pausing at every other word to ask if the spelling is correct. The process drags on so long, and the tension was so uncomfortable, that my son asks if we can just go. I express to them that the amount of trouble to go through this when the rules clearly state that it should amount to a simple request is ridiculous. So my son started his trip alone.

Their attitude was extremely condescending and just told me to go to the reassigned seat even if I explained the situation about my son. I was very frustrated by the situation and did not know what to do. They stayed far and stared at me with a look that I was interrupting other passengers behind me who tried to have a seat.

If your priority is health, especially for medical conditions or families with small children, higher quality airlines might be a better fit. The food was fine, not the freshest but not poor quality.

Title of the review could be - Delta unethical practice of giving away your airplane seat - In January 2022, my wife and I booked tickets to fly to Paris in June 2022. One day before departure my wife received a text from Delta Airlines saying her seat in business class had been changed to a seat in the main cabin on row 33. Reason given in the text was change of flight schedule (which was not true) this was flight Delta 114. The price difference between the two seats was substantial but was not mentioned in the text. We tried to call Delta to understand the change but waiting time to talk to an agent was 2 hours, so we drove to Seattle airport to discuss at the airline counter. We went to Delta airlines and the Delta agent told us that we should discuss with Air France because the flight was booked through them. She also gave the true reason for the change and said, ""this happens all the time, we give priority to people with more seniority with the company (Delta)!"" So even though we booked our flight 6 months in advance we were booted from one of the seats a day before the flight because someone else needed it? We went to the Air France agent, and they told us they never do that (change a business class ticket for a main cabin ticket because someone need your seat). Air France staff was very professional and respectful, and we had to take another flight the next day with Air France.",2,"Trip Verified","Medford","Seattle"

I purchased the tickets at the same time, but Delta did not seat us together, I asked at the airport if they could correct this and was told no. Since we couldn't sit together, I decided I would spend the 5 hours watching movies. Well my tv monitor didn't work, after having it reset I was able to watch a movie and then it stopped working again. The people next to me had no problems with their tv. After landing my husband said the same thing happened to his tv. Once we landed we could not get off the plane because there was no one there to hook the plane up to the airport. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for someone to arrive. Finally we got off the plane and went to pick up our baggage. Our luggage didn't show up along with about 20% of the other passengers. There was a gentleman standing next to us and he said he had a tracker on his luggage and it showed it was still at the plane. People started complaining about our luggage not arriving. Shortly after they announce on the intercom that they had forgot a cart of luggage at the tarmac. Of course it was pouring outside and everything was getting soaked. After almost an hour wait we found out that they did send out luggage, but to a different location. They could have announced to us that they were sending it somewhere else.

We were not trying to have an extra free night of fun or take advantage, we had responsibilities pending, it was a total nightmare.

Did not provide information whom to contact in case you need assistance. I called the agent, wait was for 34 minutes. So, I opted for a call back. Did not hear from them in next 2 hours, while I was waiting at the check-in counter. Conclusion: Delta do not provide any assistance. Operations is the critical component of their business. I would care less if an airline avoids delays and disruptions (except in cases of extreme weather). For an international traveller, it is not east to navigate airports, or make alternative arrangements in a foreign country, that too in a situation where airport staff speaks language other than yours'. While booking the DeltaOne, my agent warned me that delta flights are often delayed. I gave it a shot nevertheless. And true to their reputation, Flight was delayed by 44 minutes in App, 1 hour at the checkin counter and 2 hours at departure. As First flight was delayed, I missed my connecting flight. The options I was given were: Fly by different carrier. But I have to claim baggage, go through security and checkin again. Catch is to do it in 1hour 15 minutes!  Wait at the airport for next flight (that was exactly after 12 hours and downgraded from business to economy).Leave my check-in bag with Delta and pick it up on return flight ! This made me really furious. I wonder if Delta and its partner has any sensitivity. So, I chose option b. And adding insult to injury, I was given 15 Euro complimentary food coupons. Talk about customer care. Delta is not transparent in their conduct or concerned about customer experience.  Ground Staff the most pathetic staff I ever witnessed.  The lady in-charge of ground affairs was outright rude. Did not even listen. I kept pleading for details, but she said she would help me later. I felt a bit arrogance in her attitude. And I did not understand where the staff kept disappearing intermittently. For two and a half hours that I was in checkin line (Sky priority is a joke), I noticed staff behind screen varied between 1 and 4. Perhaps Delta is short staffed. When I managed to reach check-in counter, the lady said I cannot check-in luggage as the deadline for baggage checkin is closed. So, either travel next day (which was not feasible for me) or take bag to the gate. Catch is, I had liquids in checkin bag. So, I had to throw them away. Remember, sometimes it is not about stuff but emotions attached to it. I had something special to me in the bag (Hence my resolve to avoid Delta as much as I can). The thing that made me furious is that flight stood at the gate for another 1hour 15 minutes after boarding completed. The most disgusting feeling was the way their staff looked at me when I showed I have DeltaOne. Perhaps, I did not look good enough for their ""Elite"" service.

This airline is a joke doesn’t even qualify to be a budget LLC. I flew with them 4 sectors all in first class including delta one. First leg was SEA-LAX first class in a very old 30+ years old B737 after boarding and take off and the pilot switch off the seat belt sign I asked the notorious cabin crew if I can use the toilet and I was the very first passenger to use what’s supposed to be the first class cabin toilet and it was filthy and floor full of water and when I informed the FA he said yes it’s flooding. Prior to my departure Delta sent me via their app to choose my meals and since I have specific dietary requirements I choose what’s suitable for me. When the FA was offering the meals he came to me and with a very low and unclear tone he offered me what options they have and when I told him I have a special meal request he said we don’t serve that on domestic flights so eventually I took the oat meal with some shea seeds which turned to be an awful non edible option. After landing and waiting for my luggage I found my suitcase was damaged beyond repair I went to Delta luggage service desk I spoke with the employee who was very unhelpful and not interested to be working she just did a form and gave it to me with a tracking number and till today after almost a month still I didn’t hear from their customer service. My 2nd leg was from LAX-JFK supposed to be with B767-400 the newly refurbished delta one. As per Delta email prior to departure we need to be 2 hrs prior to departure at the airport which is 4am I was there on time and they said there is a dedicated lounge for delta one passengers . There was no one at the check in counters as they said they open by 4 am and to my surprise the Delta one dedicated check in lounge is just a partition of the check in area separated by a partition. We waited till 4:30am one one employee finally showed up and opened the partition and we did our check in finally. The only positive thing was the new delta lounge at LAX . Food options were horrible though. We boarded surprisingly to a very old dirty B767-300 with the old version of Delta one seats. Probably 25+ years old aircraft which was falling apart. Started taxing on time however for almost 1 hr the pilot was taxing around the airport and at 7 am he informed us we are going back to the gate as the plane developed a technical problem which need another hr of repair and we ended up sitting on board for another 2 hrs without even a glass of water or any interaction from the crew we eventually took off at almost 9 am 3 hrs behind our schedule and to my surprise the FA came to me and said you requested for a special meal and it’s ready so they actually serve pre ordered meals on domestic flights. Anyways we landed in JFK almost 3 hrs behind schedule at 5pm instead of 2:15 and I had to rush to catch my 7pm appointment which was so stressful with NYC traffic. The other 2 flights were nothing special LGA-BOS and BOS-DCA we’re both on old dirty EMB175 however we’re very short flights. Conclusion never again on this joke airline.

Baggage drop was difficult. We arrived to the airport 2.5 hours early. We also paid an additional $200 to book a hotel next to the airport to ensure this early arrival. This would not have been necessary if not for Delta’s cancellation of our flight. Even with staying at the airport hotel and arriving nearly three hours prior to our flight, baggage check took almost two hours. Despite so many cancellations, Delta staff did not seem to be moving with any sense of urgency for their travelers.

We did not receive any notification of this change- no text or call.

"Business","First Class","05-18","no",2,3,4,1,2,1,1,"  Delta's non-international first class is to me, a waste of money. I travelled from Sarasota, FL to Kansas City International return and spent $293 extra for first class over the comfort plus seating. Both trips were via Atlanta. I had never travelled first with Delta, so thought I would give it a try. You get early boarding, but as your seat is designated, that is really unimportant. There are as much booze and hot/cold drinks as you want, but no food, only snacks. The second leg, ATL-KCI, was over 2 hours. Delta should serve at least a sandwich/yoghurt etc for that duration. As the journey is under 900 miles you are stuck with snacks. The seats on the Boeing 757-200 and 737-900 have no lumbar support at all and I found them very uncomfortable. Bring a pillow or inflatable cushion would be my advice. On the 737, I was at the back of first class and my seat had zero recline. It was all that was available when I purchased the ticket. I had 2.5 and 3.5 hour waits at Atlanta for the next plane and was hoping as I paid for first class, a lounge would be available. No such luck. You have to be an international traveller or own a special credit card, like Delta's own or I think, AmEx. On Delta's website, I could not find any info about lounge availability, so emailed them. I'm still waiting for a reply some 3 weeks later. I tried to call, do you really need me to tell you the wait time? It's true you have 21 ins of seat width and 37 inch pitch. But for a lot less money, $293 in my case, you can get Comfort Plus with 34 inch pitch and 17.2 inch width. Very disappointed with value for money, I would not waste my time paying for this seat, you may think differently of course.",2,"Not Verified","Norfolk","Melbourne"

Four months later, Delta then changed our original flight time to 5 hours earlier for no apparent reason - with very long layovers. We immediately called Delta so try to fix this, but were told to wait until 2 months before our trip started to rebook to a later start time, and that changing the start time would require yet another phone call - which we did. After 35 minutes on hold for the 2nd time, the agent couldn't rebook our flight using Delta's internal computer system - for some strange and unknown reason - so were transferred to Delta's ""Manual Servicing"" department. And we were told that changing to a later time - which was very close to our original start time - ""may"" result in incremental charges of over $400 for each of the two flights we were trying to change back to original. 60 more minutes on hold with the ""Manual Servicing"" department - then we were disconnected.

"Solo Leisure","Economy Class","05-18","no",1,2,3,4,1,1,1," The first leg of the flight from DFW to Atlanta was nice. My husband and I landed a few minutes early, however, once we stepped off the plane, everything changed. We endured the worst airport experience ever in our combined 109 years. We had 1 hour to deboard and take the train to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Panama City, FL (ECP). After rushing to get to the other terminal, we were disappointed to see on the screen that our flight to ECP had been canceled. About that same time I received a text from Delta that due to the inconvenience, they would provide us with a complementary hotel room from a list of hotels they provided and a complementary meal. I attempted to reserve a room at one of the hotels provided, only to find that all within 30 miles of the airport were booked. We made our way back to the main terminal and proceeded to stand in a long and winding line at the ticket counter. By this time, it was about 10:30 pm. While waiting in line, I checked the Delta website for the next flights going to ECP. There were no more flights that night, all flights the following day were sold out, and all were sold out two days later except for the late flight that had a few seats remaining. I called Delta Customer Service thinking this may be quicker than waiting in line at the airport, however, the wait time to speak with a CSR was 3+ hours. After waiting in line for over 2 hours and next in line, a Delta staff member walked by the line and asked what we needed. I explained our situation that our connecting flight was canceled, according to website all flights were sold out the next 2 days and none of the complementary hotels had rooms available and was told ""you'll have to wait until next week to get to FL."" About that time, another Delta staff member said they were closing the line down because it was past time for them to go home. We proceeded to the baggage area and waited another hour in line to get our bags and were advised we could not get them that they would be on the 8 am flight to ECP and we could get them whenever we got to ECP, By this time it was 1:30 am. We had to find our own hotel and transportation ($230 + $60 to hotel + $30 from hotel) and planned on renting a car and driving so we didn't lose 2 more days of our vacation. After getting 3 hours of sleep, we returned to the airport and stood in line at Dollar Rental for 2.5 hours before deciding to go back to the airport terminal to see if they had any seat cancellations to ECP or other airports within 2 hours. We waited in line 2 more hours to finally get a Delta staff member who actually was trying to help. She was able to get me on a late afternoon flight and my husband on a flight that evening. I received a $100 credit from Delta for the inconvenience (my husband did not) and $15 voucher for a meal. But, considering we spent $320 on the hotel and transportation to and from hotel, and lost a day of vacation, we are out several hundred. Not to mention I canceled the return flight and rebooked on SW and only received a partial credit. Although I realize there is a shortage in pilots and many flights are being canceled, there needs to be a process set up to ensure those whose flights have been canceled are rescheduled on flights as soon as possible, instead of standing in line after line and not getting anything accomplished.

My flight from Reno was cancelled with no notice. Employee Lie #1-you should have received an email about cancellation. Employee Lie #2-there is only one flight leaving tomorrow, so you're stuck till then(there were, in fact other flights later in the day with other carriers-which they booked for me after spending 30 minutes on the phone). Employee lie#3-you'll have plenty of time to make your connection. LAX will have you leave the terminal and go through security to get to your next gate-missed my flight. Employee Lie#4 and 5-we will refund your AMEX card, but you can only call about it after you have completed your flights, so nothing gets messed up on your present flight.(your contract actually states that once you complete a flight, no refunds will be given). I was told this two times by two different employees, so it counts as two more lies, and clearly demonstrates the policy is to lie about refunds, so they have their ass covered once you take the flight. Lie#6-we have re-routed your bags to Atlanta so you will have them when we put you up in a hotel for the night(an honest baggage specialist explained the fact that isn't even possible, once they are checked, they go to your final destination) Lie #7-just go to customer service after you ""get your bags in Atlanta"" and you'll get a hotel voucher. ""I put a note in the system"". Nope, bags aren't here and customer service doesn't know what you're talking about. Finally, a kind soul baggage specialist took pity, and picked up the phone to the local hotel, and said ""we have another one"", and got us a hotel.

I also prepaid to check a bag that the ticketing counter told me I’d be better off not checking in because of all the changes they were having. So I paid $30 for a bag that didn’t even get checked in. So I tried to see if there were any flights that would be arriving to Indy earlier because even though I work I am also a mother to 6 year old daughter who was expecting me to be home early afternoon who I would be disappointing immensely because of this to which I was informed that there were no flights and I would just have to endure the long day. After enduring the additional 8 hours at the airport it’s finally time to check in and get on the plane.

I like flying with Delta because I like the airport in Elmira, which is 2 hours from home. My problem was coming back from Las Vegas. The plane left on time, no problem. When we got to Detroit, we were a little early, not much, but we were early. We were not able to get to our gate because something was parked in our way. It was announced that we had to wait for someone to move the vehicle before we could deplane. I was going to ask the stewardess for a seat closer to the front of the plan when I got on, because I only had about 45 minutes to get to my connecting flight to Elmira, NY. I noticed the plane was full so I didn't bother to ask. We waited approximately 10 minutes before the plane could get in its spot for passengers to deplane. According to my ticket I had approximately 45 minutes to get to my new gate for Elmira, NY. Now 10 more minutes had passed, so now I had 35 minutes to get there. Of course I was towards the back of the plan so that was about another 10 to 15 minutes. My daughter had requested a wheelchair assistance for me because I have trouble walking long distances. It was on my ticket for Service request: Wheelchair requested. When I finally got off the plane there was no wheelchair for me. There was another lady there in a wheelchair. I told the lady behind the desk I requested the wheelchair and she said just have a seat that one would be coming. I told her that I had to catch another flight in about 20 minutes and she asked me what time the flight was. I told her and she said "" Oh they are probably gone by now."" I asked her if she could call the gate that I was suppose to go to and she said just have a seat. I was anxious and I said I need to get to my gate. She said to me "" Don't yell at me"". I said I wasn't yelling and that I was concerned about making my flight. About that time a young attendant showed up with a wheelchair but he was assigned to another lady. I said could you please take me to my gate so that I don't miss my flight. He said he was only assigned to the other lady. He saw that I was upset and he said "" OK I will take you too. She we left gate A72 or gate A76 ( I am not sure) and my new gate was B2. When we got down to the tunnel for B he told his supervisor that I had to make a connecting flight to B2 and then the supervisor said it was okay for him to take me. This young boy was a little miracle for me and when we got to Gate B2 the plane was already loaded and I don't know if anyone called them to say that I was coming or not, but they greeting me very friendly. I got to my seat and minutes later we were in the air. I will fly again with Delta, but I feel there should be more time between connecting flights because of the distance between gates, especially if person has to get to a distant gate from where they landed.

Mostly because of Covid I planned my trip by train the rides (round trip) were canceled do to Covid and related personnel issues. So, the price was much higher for this round trip to Florida than anticipated. It was a little tricky to get Delta for every flight. We all hear the news about mask wearing. There are two sides to every story as they say. I have always followed the rules. So, of course I wore my mask with some discomfort. Most people complied with this law for mass transit. I did notice many airline personnel without masks. I am one to mind my own business; but I believe you lead through example. My main problem with flying anymore is the long lines-hurry up and wait. I do have metal implants that can set off security alarm systems at courthouses and airport. I also mention this. So, of course I had to be patted down. i do not like this procedure, but wanting to complete my travel plans i complied. I carry prescriptions that can easily show up on x ray, but most of the pills I carry are holistic supplements. I am sure that my ""misplaced"" luggage was no accident. This has happened to friends in the past and to my husband several years ago( Delta for sure). So, it is my belief airlines are too interested in our personal belongings. Anytime a bag was lost or delayed that said luggage contained medicine, both prescription and holistic. Air travel is very expensive and keeps going up. The inconvenience was just too much during this last trip. In my opinion Delta has higher standards than the other airlines. If i have to travel by air again I know I will choose them. Upon arrival back into Albany in March we took an awful bump upon landing. The flight was from LaGuardia to Albany around five in the afternoon.

"Family Leisure","Economy Class","08-17","yes",2,3,4,5,1,1,1,"  Let me just start by saying, riding with Delta this past Sunday was a major inconvenience. On April 3rd I arrived at the airport around 4am to catch my 6.45am flight that would later connect to another flight in ATL. My first flight of that day went smoothly, and I took note as to how the different groups of passengers were being called as to not overcrowd the area. As I had previously flown into CHI using a connecting flight, I had plans to be back in Austin by 12pm so that I could make it to work later that day. When I arrived in ATL, I walked over to station B28 as to be ready to board the plane. I arrived early and I paid close attention as the passengers were called to board the plane, however the screen never changed from saying “PRORITY”. As the announcer called passengers, she announced 1st class, main cabin 1, main cabin 2 and main cabin 3 but to my confusion she never announced BASIC. As time neared for my flight to leave, my roommate and I walked over to the station to ask when they would announce for “BASIC” to board the plane. I watched as a woman and her daughter were helped to board the plane and I stepped up to be boarded right after her. The lady spoke with me and said “I’ll be right back” before closing the door to the plane in front of me and a group containing at least 5 other passengers. The conversation that commenced after her return was very sad when referring to customer service. Not only was she rude to me as a passenger but she seemingly taunted the fact that my flight left without me on board. As she faced me, there was a lady in a red suit to her left who also claimed she wanted to help but offered a 4.40pm flight as a substitute for my 10am flight, omitting the fact that there was a 12.30am flight that she had access to add us to as standby passengers. Both ladies are a poor excuse for employees at a company that is supposed to pride themselves in customer service. Taking the conversation from 0 to 100, I believe it took more effort to be rude then it did to just help us and apologize for the inconvenience. They argued the fact, saying that I was not at the door when I clearly contacted her before she turned her back on me. Not only were the two ladies rude but they seemingly meant harm in their demeanor, and they wanted my flight to leave me behind. As a customer, I am feeling very deterred to ride with Delta again because if I paid for a flight, I should be able to ride on my flight without complications and poor attitudes from staff. I feel these two ladies were upset with the fact that passengers were slow to accept checking their luggage and they decided to take out their frustrations on the passengers. After getting help at the main Delta help desk, I felt like the employee wanted to be helpful, but the conversation could only be what I feel was “he said she said.” As the lady could do nothing to help me further with submitting a complaint about my previous interaction with the staff at B28 at 10am. The rude behavior from your Delta employees persisted and even as I was placed on standby flight for 12:31am I was still not properly confirmed on my flight. I went to the desk of station B5 and when I asked if he could explain what “standby” meant he rudely told me “Look at the screen” as he continued his conversation with a coworker. Maybe all the employees that work with Delta in ATL specifically are just used to being rude, but that's not fair to customers",2.42857142857143,"Not Verified","New York","Milan"

The gate manager promised the flight attendant that they would call me ASAP but no one called. (Still no call three days later). I called the Detroit Delta Lost and Found, the next morning, and spoke to an agent and explained that the wallet was located and positively handed off to the Manager of all the Delta gates at A27 on March 27th.

The ticket desk wasn't open, so we were stuck in the lobby with dozens of other passengers for over an hour. This caused a massive crowd and lots of confusion going thru airport security. As if that wasn't bad enough, for whatever reason despite my husband and I being ticketed on the same confirmation, we weren't assigned seats next to each other. When he made the reservations, he made sure to request a window seat for me but somehow Delta assigned us to middle seats on the opposite side of the aisle. He spent over 2 hours on hold on Saturday trying to get our seats reassigned so we would be next to each other, only for the customer service agent to tell him that we would need to speak to the agent at the desk to get reassigned. My husband tried to ask, but couldn't even finish asking his question because the agent cut him off and rudely announced over the intercom that there would be no seat reassignments. He asked the flight crew as we boarded, only to be met with blank stares and headshakes. They were unwilling to move other passengers to keep us together. We were now at the mercy of our fellow passengers, none of which were willing to switch seats to keep us together. I’m sure you’re wondering why this is important. I’ve flown frequently, and have noticed that sitting in the middle causes me to have anxiety, motion sickness, and feelings of claustrophobia. And this was all exaggerated by having to wear a mask for a prolonged period of time. My only chance for comfort on this flight, was having my husband by my side, and being switched to a window or aisle seat. I almost immediately had the worst panic attack of my life. Full out crying and shaking. The flight crew walked up and down the aisles past me, not caring that they played a part in my suffering by not moving other passengers to keep me with my husband. And my husband was unable to comfort me, being stuck across the aisle and between two strangers, so this flight was rough on him too. Finally, when one of the flight attendants did ask me what was wrong (while pushing the drink cart up the aisle) I told him, thru my tears, that I needed my husband. He asked me where my husband was, and I told him, but he did nothing to correct my situation. My panic attack lasted the duration of the flight.  I couldn’t get off the plane fast enough. I was so shaken that I didn’t want to get on our connecting flight.  All in all, your team had several opportunities to correct the situation, and dropped the ball repeatedly.

They say we’re about to take off and then we are just waiting around for two hours on the plane completely claustrophobic, not COVID friendly whatsoever and all they tell us is that they have to wait to switch directions. After they said they were able to get an alternative route they say the plane doesn’t have enough fuel to do the alternative route and say we have to go back to the gate. Then we are told that the plane isn’t allowed to take off and that we are 'fortunate' to have a gate to come back to because some planes have to just sit and wait on the runway when their is no available gates. My question is, if you originally had the flight at 7.20 departure and then delayed it to 10.10 why would you then undelay it and then only move it to 8.40? Because we’ve been on the plane for more than the second delay time of 10.10. I am extremely disappointed. This was my first experience on Delta Air Lines and this will be my last! I have flown on 100+ legs, over 10 different countries and I have never experienced an issue like this before. At least on my other airplane experience they kept us informed. Delta is not transparent and clearly is aware of the situation so why move the delay down just to have everyone sit on the plane for 4 hours past the original departure time? This is the time that I should be arriving at my destination. And the only thing they tell us is “sorry” and then offer our headphones to people and say “these are normally $2 but we’re giving them away because of the delay”. Two dollar headphones treating it like they are doing us a huge favor, they should at the very least give us food. I am blown away and shocked by the unprofessionalism of the company. Then they kick everyone off the plane after sitting in it for hours and tell us the staff needs to go home because they’ve been overworked and can’t go over their hours and that we need to just wait to see what will happen and when they will get new staff and they kept reiterating that the flight was not going to be cancelled only delayed, and then boom after waiting from 5.45pm to 12.45am (7 hours) I find out that our 1.42am (delayed 5 times) is now cancelled. They told me the next flight at 6am is fully booked and then next flight will arrive around at 6pm on Friday. I am missing an entire day in my destination zone and my original flight I had picked specifically based off the time to make sure I would not be missing any work and now I am missing an entire day worth of work and who’s going to reimburse me for that? And also let my job know?

Wanting to save time I gave them my credit card and asked to be on standby. A few more minutes went by and the gate agent informed me that it was going to take too long and she could not do it. When providing a customer, a previously very loyal customer, a seat on an aircraft it a contract between the customer and the airline.

Each one of these flights were terrible service. I have been surprised and shocked by the amount of bullying, lack of service or attention to passengers by 1st/business class crew members.  My last flight which was an overnight flight from LAX to Fort Lauderdale, which I booked business class. When I booked, I specifically asked if the flight had beds in the 1st/business class and I was told it did. Otherwise, I would never have spent the money I did to fly 1st/business overnight. Not only was there no bed - the seats didn't recline anymore then in the main cabin. I realize this sounds obnoxious to be complaining about 1st/business class seating. The issue is how much we pay for the seat and what it suppose to represent. Not only was there no bed or even an upgraded recliner seat, there were no blankets, no pillows, no service and a little snack in a cardboard box! It's pathetic and all under the disguise of Covid, yet all restaurants are open and serving people. Worst of all - the outbound flight was freezing. The cabin temperature was less then 65 degrees the whole trip. It was miserable! When I asked over and over for the cabin to be a bit warmer I was told how the cabin temp. was not controlled for my comfort, but rather the whole flight. I get it, but everyone was complaining. I won't even get started on the how aggressive the flight attendant was about masks up during sips of our drink. It's all shameful! I work very hard for my living, and in my business. I would never be allowed to treat my clients with so little regard. I wouldn't be allowed to bully or speak rudely to my clients either.

I was flying from MSP to LAX. My husband and I have flown this several years ago and it was absolutely miserable. The seats were so tight that we couldn't even stand up. My husband is 5'10"" and about 165 pounds. He is very physically fit. His knees were against the back of the seat in front of us. The seats were so narrow and tightly squeezed that he started to have a panic attack and got sick. Because of this previous experience on Delta, I decided to get first class, however, the ticket was about $2,500 which was out of the question for this trip. I got their ""comfort plus"" seats. I'm 5'7"" and about a women's size 12- so not huge. Their comfort plus seats are a complete rip-off. They are the exact seats as coach with about 2 inches more of knee room. That's it. I asked the desk attendant about why their comfort seats aren't larger or more spacious and she said ""you're not paying for more room, you're paying for amenities."" Really? So I paid $400 more for a bag of chips and a $1.00 set of ear phones? Yes. Theoretically, the comfort plus is supposed to get on first to get that precious bag space above the seats, but even that backfired, as they allow anyone to go on during their ""comfort plus"" seating and although I sat in row 10, my bag had to be put over seat 16 which made retrieving it after the flight a nightmare. It's clear that Delta does anything possible to give you the very least of everything for the most money they can nickel and dime you for and I will no longer fly with them. I was a loyal frequent flyer with Northwest before it became Delta.

I am not sure if I was lucky or I am not demanding, but my experience with the airline was quite fine so far (knock on wood). It is certainly not top notch but not horrible either. I, for sure, have encountered unpleasant experiences, but that happened to me even with the best rated airline. I think US carriers' weak spot is ground operations, with so many short, small flights that are plagued with delays, cancellations and gate changes (Asian full-service carriers use wide-body aircrafts even on one-hour flights). Now, here is my opinion about this particular flight. Ground service at EWR for Premier class was seamless but not exemplary, and that was certainly below the level of Delta One. In-flight hard product was where this flight shined. The 787-10 was shiny and clean. The Polaris seats were comfortable, spacious, and last but not least, provided a great deal of privacy. This was one of, if not the best equipment for a 5-6 hour flight I ever experienced, even when compare with intra-Asia business class from top rated airlines. On board staff were pleasant and accommodating. Food choices were limited, but I can see improvement on the taste. Food service and presentation was not quite at, though were inching back to, pre-pandemic level.

Three days in a row they cancelled the exact same flights, and had one of the flights delayed by the exact same 4 hours each evening and yet claimed each occurrence of having no crew was random. Gate agents were either clueless or rude, many were unable to perform reticketing that I was able to do through my app. Somewhere around the evening of day two of waiting, they gave everyone meal vouchers, which might have been nice had a single restaurant been open once they decided to give them to us. One agent told me that if you leave security, you can’t come back through (clearly untrue). One agent told me they could not put me on a partnering airlines flight…I confirmed with someone else that they are required to do so if they cannot serve you (they could not, it was going to be more than 24 hours). So I went back up to counter, asked again more finely and they agreed. But, she “had trouble with the system” miraculously until exactly the minute after I could no longer make that flight. They made people wait for 7 hours in the airport for flights where no crew had been scheduled and none would be coming available, three days in a row. On our last delay, we were told “they hoped our crew, arriving from another city, wouldn’t time out before being able to fly.” I’m sorry, you don’t know whether the crew were waiting for is going to be eligible to fly? Seems like someone should have that information, right? I don’t blame the airline for a cancelled flight, or even 8 cancelled flights. I blame them for a combination of stupidity and actual deception that cost many people a lot, and for a complete callous disregard for the feelings of customers.

Being a retired USAF service member, I thought I would be able to serve again by checking my carry on luggage, therefore freeing up an additional space for other passengers. I sat down by the window facing the aircraft and noticed the man that I had taken my checked in carry on luggage open a door to the outside of the walkway to the aircraft. I then saw him bring my bag out first and throw it down this 40 to 45 degree angled ramp. It went about 30 to 45 feet and bounced off of the railing at the bottom. Then he proceeded to throw approximately 13 to 15 more bags down on top of mine. As they slid down they literally bounced off of my small carry on luggage until the pressure was too much and they just simply stop bouncing and continued to press against my small luggage. When I arrived home, after my flight to Raleigh, NC and begin to unzip my bag, I immediately noticed that it had been significantly damage.

The day before I left, I tried to check in for my connecting flight and it wouldn't let me. I had to sit on hold for about an hour (while at work mind you) trying to figure out what was wrong. I was very concerned as I knew no one in the state I'd be connecting flights with, and I'd have no way to get home for a while without getting on a new flight.

I get to the gate and ask the lady behind the desk for my seat. She told me ""you're going to have to wait, we oversold this flight and I have to make sure you still have a seat"". I was very upset by this, as I had already explained that if I got stuck at that airport I would be there for a while. Eventually, she confirmed that I had a spot.

I stood there waiting for about 45 minutes trying to find my bag. It never came up, so I went to the baggage office, where they initially tried to brush me off and said ""you just didn't wait long enough, you need to go back and look more"". This made me extremely irritated, as it was obvious they just wanted to get me out of their way, and they didn't really care that my bag was missing. Even when I explained that I had important medications in there, their attitudes did not change. Eventually, a very nice agent named Arthur helped me get a ""lost or mishandled claim"" filed, and he was probably the only helpful Delta associate I dealt with this trip. I am currently on hold with the airline, still trying to figure out my bag. I've been transferred twice and have had no communication on their end in over an hour and a half.

The transatlantic flights were to be on Alitalia, however on September 1 with a hurricane approaching the northeast coast forced a closure of JFK NY airport. As a result Delta offered an alternative flight from Boston to Amsterdam and then to my final destination, Rome. This avoided New York and the hurricane altogether. I thought my departure and arrival problems were resolved until: 1) Although I paid for a premium transatlantic seat, I was given an economy seat. I specifically asked the attendant at the boarding gate to confirm that I had a premium seat. He said I did which was not true and I discovered this after I boarded the plane. Therefore, I can only conclude that the individual at the desk either outright lied or was completely incompetent. Either way he did not care one bit about the customer. 2) Delta delayed my luggage. I arrived in Rome on Thursday. I did not receive my luggage until the following Monday. 3) I tried to get a partial reimbursement from Delta for the cost difference between the economy seat and the premium seat. They have told me that although they were the ones who made the mistake, they could not provide a partial refund and that I would need to go through Alitalia. To date Delta has not provided any assistance in obtaining my partial refund. In fact they have only wasted my time with numerous phone calls with very lengthy waiting time on the phone. Lastly, it took them more then a week to get back to me and tell me that Delta could not help and that I must go through Alitalia. The representative on the phone chose to argue with me rather than help. I was neither rude nor aggressive on the phone since I know that would not have helped.

We were of course very excited being our first time there and this was our second trip together as a couple. We started at Grand Rapids and had 1 stop at Detroit then to New Orleans. The flight from Grand Rapids to Detroit was great. The flight from Detroit then to New Orleans was horrible. I was surprised to find no TV screen in first class for that long of a flight? Very disappointing. then we noticed the silver ceiling tile about the rest room was falling down on 1 side. Not a good thing to see the airplane falling apart. Our trip back was not any better! Again leaving from to Detroit in first class with no TV screen. Then we land in Detroit to find we have a change in flight and are stuck at the airport for 3 hours till they had another plane. We finally board and are being told they are all about safety and keeping things sanitized. Thats a joke! We get to our first class seat to find finger prints on the window, dirty hand prints on side walk and arm rest and garbage in seat pocket. Then again still no TV screen. The flight attendants were being very rude and harassing customers about everything .. we all just wanted to get to our last stop. You would think they would be more understanding that we had a 3 hour delay! I was told to push my purse further under seat in front of me ... yea 2 inches really made a difference there. When we landed in Grand Rapids the ceiling panel above us came down and the flight attendant had to push it back up.  We felt totally unsafe on your plane. I made a complaint to delta.

No one would assist us to make our connection easier. My biggest complaint is that they put my two year old in a row by herself, without me or my husband. They would not change her seat.

I sure hope they make me wait a few more hours to figure that out. Remember, time is money, and Delta couldn’t possibly care less about your time as a customer because then they’d have to hire more people and that wouldn’t help their margins and stock price.

When flying with this airline a certain level of quality is expected and I am disappointed. It started out with the flight being delayed until they had access to a full crew and departure time was pushed by twice for that purpose. Then the pilot comes out to say due to regulations he could only work a certain number of hours and would not be able to fly the aircraft and we would have to wait for another pilot. Results were that the flight got pushed to the next morning . During the night the departure gate changed 3 times. Once they arrived in the morning they were a pilot short and pushed departure time once again. For those that opted to stay in the airport and wait, the overnight crew was nonchalant and blaise about the whole ordeal.

"Couple Leisure","Economy Class","04-16","yes",4,1,2,3,4,1,2," Our flight (DL386) LAX-BNA on July 25th started off not well. I was traveling with my family (Myself, wife, son & Daughter). My wife was flying first class with my daughter and I was flying comfort plus with my son. Somehow leading up to the flight our seats were changed without any notice. We are traveling with small children and by law they can not sit by themselves. We found out about the seat changes trying to check in 24hrs in advance. We could not fix our seats together and were told (after holding for 6 hours on the phone) to wait until we reached the gate. We arrived at the airport and there was only one gate attendant with a long line of customers. She was not attending to any of them. Finally someone in line spoke up and she was flustered. She dismissed half of the people in line to go sit down. They were told to deal with their issue at the scanning of boarding passes. We were still seat separated from our children. I finally spoke up and she addressed the situation to get us seated together. Our flight departed a bit late and upon approach into BNA our captain notified us that there was heavy weather and we may have to divert to Memphis. He circled three times and aborted the landing at BNA. We landed in Memphis (1/2 hour from BNA) and are notified that we need to refuel before we can go back and to land at BNA as the storm has now cleared. We now hear from the Captain on the PA that he and his cockpit crew have ""timed out"". We are asked to deplane and wait for alternative cockpit crew. Our flight was initially supposed to land at BNA at 5:11pm, It's now 5:55 as we begin to deplane at Memphis. We find ourselves now at an airport with no restaurants open. Our children are starving. I spend $80 buying junk and jerky at the airport store to tide them over. We now hear from the gate that our incoming pilots will not arrive until 8:30pm (which actually turned into 9:45 because of the incoming delayed flight from Atlanta). We contemplate driving ourselves back to BNA, but that would be a 3 hour drive with the kids. We are now held captive in an airport with no food, an extremely long day of travel and no help from Delta staff or crew. They tell us the only thing available at this airport right now is the drinking fountain and then laugh about it. I am extremely disappointed with the lack of planning and customer service coverage the Delta staff. I understand the timing out of pilots, however the situation after the diverted flight should have been handled better. We were not the only parents with upset, hungry and tired children so my feelings here are mutual as all passengers on flight DL386 where unhappy about the lack of customer service and planning. There was nothing offered to snack on let alone to drink. Even as we re-boarded with the new pilot crew. The staff on flight DL386 didn't offer any snacks that we could see from our seats in first class. Yet when the pilots came on board they handed them both large Bistro Snack Boxes. I'm extremely disappointed with Delta and the crew. This situation could have been handled so much better. We finally got to BNA by 10:30pm( 5 hours after our initial arrival time to BNA) It's now 11:30pm by the time we get the kids home. They're now eating at 11:45pm.

Due to religious reasons, they wanted to have a man sit there. We both said no, because the man across the aisle was sitting with his wife and son. I suggest airlines screen their passengers better for religious preferences. Furthermore, these two young men took their masks off most of the flight. I told one of the flight attendants, and she told them to put them on, which they did until she left. A passenger behind us also told them to put them on to no avail. Flight attendants walked up and down the aisle and never told them to put their masks on. Personally, I wore two masks which I didn't take off the entire flight even to drink water.

This was my first and LAST time flying Delta. I had originally booked a roundtrip, direct flight from ONT to ATL months in advance. Then, a few weeks before, the scheduled flight Delta kept changing my return home flight time (3 times). Eventually they had changed it from a departure time of 5pm to 8am, which is a huge difference in time change. Not only did they change the time, but they changed the return airport from ONT to LAX!

He told me he could make the changes and reschedule me to a direct 4:30pm flight. I assumed things were fixed. It wasn’t until the day before my return flight, when I was supposed to check in, did I realize that he still had my flight booked for the wrong airport (LAX). I then had to spent over 3 hrs on hold waiting to speak to a Delta customer service representative, and over a half hour talking to someone to get my flight fixed. She told me all the direct flights to ONT were sold out, and I would have to take a connecting flight which would be later in the evening arriving to ONT at 11:30pm. I asked if I could wait for standby on a direct flight at 5:50pm. She said she would put me on the list for standby. I was waiting early for standby at the airport until all passengers had finished boarding, as I was directed by the gate Delta attendant. They even said there was one seat that I could take, but when they tried adding me to the seat, they said there was a problem.

"Family Leisure","Economy Class","03-16","no",1,2,3,4,5,1,2,"Recently this Thursday, I had the worst experience I have ever encountered on a flight. My family and I had important plans to fly into New York, LGA. However, during our flight, about a half an hour away from LGA the captain of the plane informed us we will be having a delay and they will be stopping the plane in Atlanta. We were upset but understood this is due to weather conditions, and they let us know it would probably be a 1-2 hour delay and to stay close to the terminal when we get off the airplane. When we got off, we were then informed that our flight was actually going to be delayed until 8am in the morning! Shocked, we proceeded to find a help desk to see what we were going to do. As we were walking, we noticed another flight that was boarding for the same place we were supposed to go to, LGA! We were so confused on how they were able to go but we were not? We stood in a very long line with only 2 employees at the counter, and we received a hotel voucher for the Radisson which gave us a $40 discount, we still had to pay $108 for the hotel room which was shocking to us! We were also told that we would use the same tickets we had tomorrow morning at the Atlanta Airport. When we asked an Atlanta Airport employee where the shuttle was for the hotel, he looked at us completely clueless and like he was under hard influence of something, so we kept walking and hoped we would eventually find the shuttle ourselves! We were also told the flight would be departing at 8am, so we had to wake up early in the morning and catch the 5.30am shuttle to Atlanta Airport. This is really when the true nightmare began, as we asked an employee where we should go with our tickets, and she told us since we already had the tickets from our delayed flight we could hop in line for the regular security route. So, after waiting 15-20 minutes in line we went up to the employee who scans the boarding passes and was told “We cannot take these passes you need new ones, leave out that exit door” and we were rudely told to leave as the employee got frustrated with us as we were trying to explain our situation. We then got in line for Special Services, which the security employee directed us too by pointing. It was 5.30am and there was no employees there to even help us yet because they were in a briefing, so we were told by another employee they won’t be available until 6am! Astonished, we got in another line for Special Services and waited about 25 more minutes. We were then greeted by a man all the way at the right side corner, and we attempted to explain our situation with him. He got very rude with us and told us our flight was now taking off at 6.30am and that he would not give us new boarding passes and insisted that we could use the same ones we had even after getting kicked out of security! My father tried to explain further to him, and he replied “Would you rather just sit here and argue with me and miss you flight?” I was astonished by this type of treatment, I truly felt like I was highly disrespected after spending over 1000 dollars this month on flights with Delta! He refused to even look at our boarding passes. We then headed over back by security and began trying to explain our situation to another lady who told us we needed new boarding tickets as well. However, another worker heard us in distress and walked over to us.

First there was no fast track security for first class passengers which is off putting when you have a significantly more expensive ticket. The lunch box given was pitiful and sad and quite frankly betrayed laziness. We are already past that curve of covid where you can get away with not offering service using that excuse. It is blatantly an act of being cheap on the part of the airline. The service was awful. The young gentleman that served us was probably the least friendly flight attendant I have ever encountered especially given he is serving first class passengers which makes it worse. Unsmiling, unfriendly, looked bored and uninterested in his job. There was a young lady who also came and checked the cabin during take off and landing equally unfriendly and sporting 2 inch white nails which was shocking.

But she advised us to get off the plane. Then she proceeded to tell the captain and redcoat she felt endangered.  To end the story that left me sleeping on the floor until at the airport until this morning at 7:30am. I'm writing my review on the plane waiting to take off and I'm livid! This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had flying in 30 years. No beverages, rude people, old planes, and allowing some inexperienced individuals with no one to answer to running the show.

They were the last people we saw before we left to go to the hotel and the first ones we saw the next morning. Our new seat assignments allowed me and my 2 kids to sit together.

I was told by the boss of the attendants on the plane that he was obligated to serve nuts if a passenger requested it. I understand that some people may bring their own snacks, but not serving nuts shows that you care about my safety and are reducing my risk of a life threatening reaction by almost 100%. Once the captain heard my story, he had no issues switching the snacks to just pretzels and cliff bars. He even walked through the plane to tell everyone nuts would not be served. Then the attendants listened to him, after making me feel less than human for having an allergy and told that people’s need to snack on nuts was more important than my life.

"Couple Leisure","Economy Class","01-16","yes",4,1,2,3,4,5,1," We were a party of 4 flying from Denver, CO to Maui, HI. We had booked this trip almost 6 months prior, and I had a choice of seats, and picked out the ones I wanted. However this flight was switched a few months back, and although they specified to check the schedule change, which I did, and there was just a few minutes difference in time. I did not think that I would have to check my seats, as I assumed they would transfer with the flight. They did not! I found this out the day before our flight, and I scrambled to find adjoining seating for the 4 of us, and was successful in locating seating for us, it was in the middle and not window seats like I had originally chosen. I called Delta hoping that I would be able to speak with an agent and get things changed. I was told by a recorded message that the wait time could be up to 3 hrs! which is ridiculous, however, I was determined to speak to someone to get changes made to our seating arrangement. 1 hr went by, and then 2! Still no answer. After waiting until 3 hrs and 3 minutes, I decided i had had enough, and took a screen shot to prove to Delta that I had tried to make changes to my seating arrangements to no avail!. On to Baggage Check. Check-In went reasonably well, and the Baggage Check-In Process went fairly quickly. This was the first time we had flown Delta in a long time. We usually travel using Southwest, and are used to their Baggage Check-In and Boarding Process. Needless to say, I was surprised at the baggage fees we were charged. On Southwest your baggage is free! Not the case with Delta. It cost $30 for the 1st checked bag and $40 for a second. For the 4 of us we had 6 bags, and it cost me $200! I should have done more checking on this prior to purchasing tickets. The only reason for flying Delta in the first place was that they fly larger jets to Hawaii than Southwest, and so we thought we'd be more comfortable, which we later found out not to be the case. Next came the boarding process, and after waiting for everyone else to board, finally it was our turn to go and find our seats that I was forced to endure. Our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City was delayed due to an air conditioning issue? In any case it caused enough of a delay that when we landed in Salt Lake City, we were told that they were doing a final boarding call for our flight to Maui. We ran with our carry on luggage down the concourse for about a quarter mile or so, and they were just closing the door on the jetway and informed us that we had just barely made it. We told them that there were a couple of others from our flight also on their way, but they did not seem concerned, and closed the jetway door behind us. Flight to Hawaii was pretty uneventful, but while our beverage requests were taken care of, it was evident that the flight attendants were not happy with their jobs. It seemed like everything that we asked of them was a burden. The snacks are another thing. No variety at all. We were offered the same snacks over and over on each of the 4 legs of our trip. Almonds and Biscoff cookies.  We will be flying Southwest next time. About the only annoying thing about that airline is that you need to be prompt in your check-in 24 hrs in advance in order to get an A or B pass.",2.85714285714286,"Trip Verified","CDG","SEA"
"Solo Leisure","Economy Class","11-15","yes",2,3,4,5,1,2,3," We were returning from a family vacation first time traveling with kids. We had a flight booked with Delta from ATL airport on Father’s Day leaving at 12:15 PM going to JFK Airport . We arrived at the airport three hours early as we try to prepare flying with small children. First we were never told that while traveling with an infant on lap we will be required to formally check in and will not be able to use the kiosk. The lines of formally check in took us about an hour and a half with two young children in a double stroller. We kept telling them was there another way for us to check in or asking for help as both children were not able to tolerate the wait. We were told we had to wait in that line however they were pulling off people with pets to make sure they were checked in on time for their flight. An hour and a half later we finally reached the check-in, we checked in went through security and arrived at the gate at 12:03 PM where there was a whole debacle of people Up in arms as they were flying standby. I tried to make my way up to the counter to explain we had tickets and we’re on this plane. The girl told me we were too late and our tickets were given away and to go to see customer service. There I am traveling with a one-year-old and a three-year-old and our bags trying to get on my flight that they gave our tickets away as we were not there 15 minutes early. However the plane was still there still boarding but they gave our tickets away. We headed to customer service for Delta by the time we got a supervisor involved the plane had already left. Once the supervisor realized this was a mistake made and we should’ve been able to board our scheduled flight he put us on the next flight which was hours later. Now sitting in an airport for 5 to 6 hours with two babies was a horrible experience. But this is not the worst of it we finally land at JFK airport about 6:45 PM with our two children to find our luggage was not there. Delta at JFK told us he never left Atlanta and he said it up to be shipped to our residence home for the following day. The following day came and our luggage with never sent I called five different times and heard five different stories first I heard it was in Atlanta then I heard it was in JFK then I heard it came in on the first flight that we were scheduled to be on it don’t know what happened to it then I heard that it came in on the second flight that we were on they don’t know what happened to it and then I was hung up on. Finally being fed up I demanded a callback from a supervisor as in this luggage was medical equipment for my infant daughter. My daughter was born with bilateral hip dislocation and was it a body cast the first half of her life no she currently uses a hip brace to prevent her hips from falling out of place. She is supposed to wear this every night at bedtime this brace cost a few thousand dollars. After being so rudely treated and lied to I had to let the Delta representative know that any harm done to my child’s progress with her hips Delta would be accountable for and I will make sure of it then all the sudden a supervisor called me back.

"Family Leisure","Economy Class","01-16","yes",2,3,4,1,2,3,4,"  May 21st – May 25th 2021, we flew to EYW from PWM with LGA as a stopover. We’d flown to Key West in FLA in October 2020 First Class and Tampa in January Comfort Plus, and loved both trips. What we didn’t realize is that the planes we’d be flying on this time around were smaller. 2 seats on one side, 1 on the other. There was no separation, which eliminated the “exclusive” feel we’d enjoyed with our first trip. Additionally, there were no TV screens. On the December flight, we were able to watch entire feature films. Additionally, each of the four legs of the trip were different in terms of food or drink service. Leg 1 - PWM to LGA we were offered snack boxes in addition to water, drinks, etc. On the shorter LGA to EYW, we were not offered the boxes. On the return trip, no snack boxes were even offered. Added to the substantially downgraded “first class” experience due to the smaller aircraft, this all contributes to an overall sloppy and inconsistent feel, that is to say, “You never know what you’re going to get until you get on board”. On the leg back, we were looking forward to a couple of the new margaritas in the can. They were amazing, having discovered them on the way down. But, they only packed 2 cans for the whole trip for the plane, the attendant says this happens a lot. We’ve had similar experiences where we weren’t able to get water because you’d run out of the little 8 oz bottles. That’s just unacceptable. (As a side note, an 8 oz bottle of water on a 2-3 hour flight offers little in the way of meaningful hydration. I generally ask for two for each of us. Perhaps a more practical size would be more appropriate?) At the Key West airport on the leg back to LGA, we were the last ones to board. Why? Because the young attendant did not call first class. When we asked about it, she said, “well I called Diamond, that’s the same thing.” Well, no, it’s not. This same attendant was very unhelpful when we asked her about boarding passes. On our last trip to KW we had to print boarding passes vs. using our mobile ones. She said she didn’t really know, they prefer printed but that we should be able to use the mobile, well, can we use them or not? Finally, I’m hard of hearing. I understand that there’s not a lot that can be done because of the mask wearing mandates, but you’ve really got to teach your employees how to make clear announcements. How to annunciate properly, speak reasonably slowly and loudly enough. I’ve never felt so discriminated in my life, having to ask people around me if you’d said anything important. (Most of them didn’t hear the announcements either). On the first leg from PWM to LGA there was one young lady who was wonderful. Every other attendant gave us the impression that we were a bother. So all in all, we paid for a first class experience, and did not receive it on several fronts. We found little similarity between our December & January first class trips and this one. We’re seriously disappointed, and will be sure to ascertain what type of plane we’ll be flying on and get clear on boarding and offerings. Additionally, as a direct result of our disappointment, we plan to book our next first class trip with either AA or United.

Paid extra for them to change the flights back to the original flights booked, just to have them tell me the departure flight was 'canceled' and they re-booked us for the same flying times, just an entire 24 hours later.

As an aside, Delta's policy for flights to South Korea is ridiculous and doesn't follow the actual government guidelines.

The Korean government policy is that the 72 hours resets at 12AM every day so it shouldn't matter what the hour of day it is. From the Korean government website: ""The test needs to be issued no more than 72 hours before the departure date. *For example, for travelers whose flight departed on May 10, 2021 at 10:00 a.m., documents issued on or after May 7, 2021 (past 0:00) will be accepted.""

When trying to check in, the gate attendant first said we got NO checked bag for the child's ticket & after talking about it a while, they said, Oh actually you do get a checked bag, but it has totally different dimensions than a normal checked bag, and it can only be 10lbs. All of this info, even though our email confirmation did not only NOT say that, but said that we should get a 50lb bag for FREE. On a call after the fact while filing a complaint about the issues with the flight and trying to explain my experience as a customer, the representative spent the whole time contracting me and his/herself. And even though they (and all the other Delta people I had talked to in my experience checking in and boarding - everyone contracted themselves regularly) didn't know all the info, they told me I should have known because somehow the information was clear ... to everyone... and it was my fault for not knowing the rules? So people working for Delta couldn't figure it out every time I talked to someone after arriving to the airport, but it was definitely the customer's fault for not knowing?

This situation is not the first time its happened but the communication has never improved, we were notified at 3pm that our 6.40 flight was delayed till 8.30, but being 1.5 hours from the airport we were in the cab, so we went back to the hotel. 30 minutes later we received a text that our flight was on time, so now we are cutting close to get back to the airport. 5 hour hold time to call someone. At the airport we were told flight is delayed till 10 but we needed to be there at the original time to get thru customs, ok but how about putting that in the text. When they finally cancelled the flight they told us the original flight would leave at 10.15 but stop in Atlanta. Atlanta was experiencing tornados, so being stuck in Atlanta didn't seem like a good option, so we rebooked at the same time the next day, only to find out an hour later that the 10:15 flight was non-stop to JFK.

I live 20 minutes from the airport and I chose Delta because it was a direct flight. These are difficult to get from Scotland as BA does not route a single flight from Scotland to the USA. You have to go via Heathrow. First May email comes saying not only am I now leaving at 6.00am in the morning instead of 10.30 but from Edinburgh to Amsterdam and then Amsterdam to New York - 15.5 hours. Delta fly daily from Edinburgh to JFK and while I understand they might have cancelled some of them due to Covid I did not expect them to cancel every, single flight. Every, single, day. I was quite surprised because when I tried to book by seats quite few were already taken. So many people have been inconvenienced. I had booked on the premise that if Scotland was shafted yet again as the easy option, they would fly me from another airport, one within the UK. They fly from Heathrow on both Delta operated flights and code share with Virgin too. But they routed me backwards via Amsterdam. Nine hours after I left the house for my 20 minute trip to the airport, I would be back over UK airspace again, right back to where I started.  They would not put me any of the Heathrow flights because they would have to pay BA to fly me there from Edinburgh and they do not code share with them.  They would not give me my money back because I am not American. US law means they have to refund American citizens if they cancel flights with no comparable alternative but as they advised me, they can pretty much do what they want with others. No legal requirement to compensate me or route me even from the same country. I could rebook but they would keep my money until I did. For a year. Then they would keep it all.  So, I had to cancel and rebook from Heathrow and pay the cost of getting myself a return flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow. Apart from the totally inconvenient flight times and flight changes from direct to indirect flights and 2 set sets of immigration to queue up for, I had no wish to have to check if 2 countries still had their borders open to UK citizens until 22nd June. If you live in the EU then Book with European airline in these uncertain times.

They announce the flight was overbooked and offered $400 for someone to take a later flight. No one took it. Eventually they landed on $600 and someone gave in. $600? I got a $50 hotel room to wait an entire day. Moving on, we go to board and they gave each of us separate seats. I asked if there was a way my 3yr old could sit by either myself or my boyfriend and they said I could figure it out myself.

On top of that they made us pay $440 EUR for our one checked luggage and 1 carry on item per person which is covered by our tickets we purchased.

Delay after delay after delay after delay came and went.

I said ok, fine. 2 minutes later they said they couldn't get me that because someone took the seat they had for me and it was the last one. OK, I figure well, at least I get to New York and surely Delta will get me to Cleveland, both being large cities. So the original flight delays more and more and they they find me again and say...we know you have been here for a very long time Sir, but we can't get you to Cleveland today""?

Don't be fooled, they are none of that if they cannot get a passenger to a city like Cleveland Ohio on a day they ticket you for. Not a holiday, not a busy time of year, nope, just a bungling company with terrible service that can't deliver on their service.

Delta, without any notice or email or compensation or anything, put someone in the middle seat between me and my mom. All 3 of us were confused as Delta has a policy to not do this, so we consulted the gate agent who was more than happy to re-seat her since there was a few no-shows. However, this should not have happened in the first place. Normally my experiences on Delta are 10/10 but unfortunately this was just not the same. Some flight attendants on the 2nd flight also seemed a bit cranky and not happy to be there, though some were very nice as well.

I was moving from OKC to Denver, so this was a one way flight. Although there were nonstop flights to Denver I could've taken out of OKC, I chose Delta regardless if I had to take two flights to get to my destination cause they still had social distant seating on all their flights. Which made me feel comfortable since it'd be my first time flying since the pandemic started. Check in at OKC wasn't a hastle. Since I have a Gold Card, they still accepted my bag even though it was a few pounds over the limit. At the gate, I spoke to the agent handling boarding about the precautions. She was very nice and descriptive about their cleanliness and cleaning procedures. She was kind enough to give me a goodie bag filled with cookies, sanitizing wipes and a thank you post card. Flight to SLC from boarding to landing was ontime, smooth and pleasant. Connection at SLC was a little surprising. I learned we'd be deplaning at a remote spot and be bussed to the terminal due to construction I wasn't aware they were doing on some of the terminals. When we deplaned, we had to share two buses with another flight that had just arrived. Both buses ended up being at full capacity. Meaning we weren't able to social distance for the entire bus ride. In this environment, that was dangerous to do. I feel Delta could've done a better job mitigating this issue. Afterwards, the rest of the connection was fine. Boarded, departed and arrived on time. Flight attendants on the flight were nice enough to let me move to an empty row because of my discomfort of sharing a row with another passenger, even though the middle seat was open. Overall, great experience with Delta in a pandemic. If they could just be more cautious about their remote stand connection process, that would be best.

"Couple Leisure","Economy Class","08-15","yes",1,1,1,2,3,1,1," Thanks Delta, for reminding me that my pockets are not deep enough for you all to care how me or my property is treated. I've been lied to, witnessed a clear violation of how things are supposed to be handled, and I've been ghosted. Some backstory: relocating as a remote worker. I packed my work equipment with multiple layers of bubble wrap and clothing, put them into a box, and sealed it with guerilla tape. I checked my box as an oversized special item to prevent any mishandling. The lady at the counter marked the box as fragile and oversized. She then told me that I could claim the item in a designated area as it would not drop down the conveyor belt. She then asked me to sign away all liability saying that they'll take REASONABLE care of my property but aren't liable for damages. Well, Delta's definition of reasonable care means that they'll stack boxes on top of a box marked fragile, send it over to standard baggage claim tumbling down the conveyor belt, bend the box(how?), Then the coup de grâce, puncture the box and it's content. So I see the box tumbling down the conveyor belt and I'm dmbfounded. This is not what was discussed. Its about to flip over the sides since it tumbled end over end but luckily It caught balance and landed with a thump back onto the belt. I go to the counter to explain to the lady who's clearly annoyed, what happened to my box. She asked me to test if everything in there works. I couldn't find the wires for the monitors and we ended up speaking to LAX. I pointed out every bend and hole on the box saying, this isn't reasonable care. After seeing the box the agent said I can go home to buy wires and test the monitors within 24hrs, email him and then we'll work something out if it's broken. I'm guessing this was to just get me out of the airport because he later ghosted me. The next morning I got some new wires and plugged in my BenQ which worked fine. I then unwrap my dell 27"" ultrasharp ips monitor and see what appears to be a hole that's penetrated the first two layers of the screen. Naive and hopeful, I plug in the monitor thinking that it'll still work and if it's just a scratch then I can live with that. But after plugging it in That scratch started to look more like fractures as the screen begin to illuminate. It was done. I called Delta's help support number, when I finally got through to someone I barely got out half a sentence before being interrupted. The gentleman proceeded to interrupt me a few more times until I finally got my story out and after a final interruption I just hung up. I emailed Scott to update him on the progress I had made, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger to Delta to figure out how to actually put a claim in for the issue. Scott replied back thanking me for keeping him in the loop. I finally got a ticket submitted and within an hour someone had already denied my claim. They offer me $250 travel coupon. I absolutely decline and you can remove it from my account then remove my account. I send another message to the agent , he was friendly so I'm sure he'd be willing to help, nope. He ghosted me. I've made quite a few trips with Delta in the past for work and I religiously chose them because of their seating space and how easy it is to check in. No more. I'd rather fly Spirit.

I wanted to talk to the skymiles guys to see if I could upgrade to Comfort + using my points. The reservation agent said she would give me until 11 pm the next day to pay for the ticket and would switch me to the skymiles guy and I could either pay for the ticket with my credit card while talking to him and find out if I could use my points to upgrade at the same time. Transferred me, spent another hour on hold, finally got a guy and in the middle of our conversation we got cut off. Got a confirmation email from Delta, but when I tried to pay for the ticket online it could not find the reservation. Called Delta again, again on hold for well over an hour. When I did get through I was told that the ticket price was no longer what I was quoted but had increased to $811.00. I was well within the grace period for purchasing the ticket. I was not told by the first agent that the price was subject to an increase. Talked to a supervisor who said there was nothing he could do, so I paid the difference. This is bait and switch.

I spoke with a Delta customer service representative on 5 March 2020 and requested a full refund. The customer service representative consulted with a supervisor and agreed to give me a full refund without penalties as this was a COVID-19 related situation. As of 4/28/20 I have not received a refund. After spending much time in a call queue, a representative informed me that a refund would not be coming and I would only receive a voucher with time limitations, despite being told that I would receive a full refund in March. I was then transferred to another customer service representative who would only repeat the same lines over and over again. The representative refused to provide me with a transcript of my previous call, refused to transfer me to another person to provide assistance, and was incredibly rude and condescending. He would not send me anything in writing, stating a policy that he couldn’t provide me with either. The representative acknowledged that I was told to expect a refund and then told me that I would never get a refund and that no one in Delta could help me. He then hung up on me after I again asked to speak with someone who could help me. Delta is refusing to honor a refund that was already promised by a Delta employee who was authorized to promise a refund. Delta's customer service is extremely offensive. It is very clear that their only role is to stonewall customers in hopes that they give up and go away.

I wanted to take this time to highlight the good. On March 13th I was in Miami and the corona-virus was becoming a huge issue and my mom thought it would be a good idea that I flew home and I too thought it would be a good idea so I proceeded to book my flight to leave the following morning. When I booked the flight I thought I put insurance on the ticket turns out I did not. The next morning came and unfortunately I missed my flight I was a bit upset but not surprised because I honestly was not prepared. Knowing that I had not put insurance on the ticket I was upset that I would now be out of $130. With everything going on, money no matter the amount, is very much needed for rainy days but I knew that my own irresponsibility had put me in this position so I just let the situation go. So fast forward to today, March 31st, I had got paid and when I went to go check my account there was an extra $130 in my account. Of course at this point I had forgotten all about the ticket and I had already knew I didn't buy the ticket insurance so I was not at all expecting any type of refund. So I went in my payment history to see where the money had come from and sure enough it said ""Delta Airlines"". That's the difference between a good company and a GREAT company. I just wanted to say I truly appreciate the Delta community because they did not at all have to do that, but they did!

With customer service phone-lines bogged up because of the crisis, we decided to take our chances and head to the airport a day early to see if there was any chance we could return sooner. Luckily, we were met with Dionne at the Delta Check-In (Terminal 2, at LaGuardia airport). Dionne had to deal with a faulty system that forced her to enter our passport credentials manually, but she handled it with grace and humour (which was really needed at that moment). She also did everything she could to find all the options available to us. Thankfully, she was able to get us on a flight later that day, direct to Toronto. Regardless of that, she acted as a professional, very calm and direct, and most importantly as a compassionate human to two Canadians hopped up on little sleep and lots of anxiety and uncertainty.

Trusting them to take care of your luggage. Trusting them to provide you with accurate information with anything regarding your travels. I have trusted Delta Airlines for a very long time. I am even a Delta SkyMiles member, as I had planned on being a customer of theirs for a very long time. But I am afraid to say that that trust has reached its demise after today. Today, I flew to Dallas for a business trip that included a golf outing. I was particularly excited about this golf outing, as I had just bought a brand new $300 club that I was very eager to try. However, the club did not come in the mail before I had to ship the rest of my clubs out via a 3rd party service. I immediately called Delta to see if bringing a single golf club onto the plane was possible. I was very doubtful that this would be allowed, but I thought it would be worth making a phone call just to make sure. When I called Delta’s baggage support line, the man who answered the phone told me in complete confidence that it would not be an issue. I even made sure to ask if I would have any trouble getting it through security. He assured me that it would be fine and that I could store the club in the planes closet or just hold it with me in my seat. This information made me very happy and reinforced the high quality of service and excellence that I believed Delta Airlines provided to all their passengers. When I arrived at the airport, I went to check in a bag. While I was at the counter, 3 women were standing there as one of them was checking in my bag. Not one of them noticed the golf club I was carrying and recommended that I checked it in. But why would they? They were probably just as clueless of the rules and regulations as the man I spoke with on the phone. I got to the front of security with 30 minutes until my flight was supposed to leave when one of the officers told me that I was not allowed to bring my club through. I assured him that I spoke with Delta and they said it was ok. It turns out that all sporting equipment must be checked in, no matter how small it may be. I sprinted back to the check in desk to try and check the club in, but it was too late to do so. I even tried to go store it, but the crew was switching shifts and would not be open for another 15 minutes. I did not have 15 minutes. Long story short, I was forced to throw away a brand new $300 golf club because of the false information that I was provided by Deltas clueless support team and the lack of awareness of their check-in team.

The seating was amazing and the seats all had massive padded headrests which were also adjustable, something very rare on such a small narrowbody aircraft. The food was also amazing and Delta have a wide variety of complimentary snacks and beverages, but I also got their protein box -s easily worth the $9 I paid for it. The only thing holding this back from a 10/10 was that the in-flight entertainment system on my plane wasn't working, but an issue like this is quite rare. We just got unlucky, but I didn't mind it all that much as I slept for most of the flight.

Instead of Delta making an exception for the 5 minutes we were late to check in our bags (apparently you have to arrive no later than 45 minutes before the departure time), they told me there was nothing they could do and that if I wanted to transfer my ticket, it was going to cost $618 per person (x3), or I could just buy three new tickets for the next flight (4 hours later) for $488 per person,  which included my significant other and my 4 year old.  Delta made ZERO attempt to assist my family in getting home, getting our bags to the plane, or even the next flight would have been fine, and gave us a choice: You either cough up at least $1,500 or we are out of luck. We had to spend $600 in renting a car, staying at a hotel, gas and purchasing meals to drive from Atlanta to Miami for 10+ hours of driving time. This was a power play on behalf of Delta and I will take this into consideration when booking my next flight. ALL Delta cares about is money.",2.28571428571429,"Trip Verified","JFK","YVR"

As I entered the plane a stewardess confronted me rudely and told me I had to check the bag. Again I kindly asked if I could just check if there was room as I was the last passenger on the plane and the delay would make me late already. She angrily told me there is no room with her hand on my bag. I said ok, sure, and she took my bag back out.

I took Delta flights multiple times between Europe and Seattle in the past 2 years and am still wondering how this airline has got only 3 stars. Based on my experience DL has the best long haul economy service that no other carrier I have ever used could beat (LH, OS, EK, KL, QR, HU). The reasons are the next: 1) A330s and 767s: 2-whatever-2 layout is much more traveller friendly than 3-whatever-3 (worst experience is KL’s 787). 2) stable wifi: Gogo did a great job. This time there was some short connectivity issue over the Canadian permafrost 3) clean cabin: I don’t know why this is a big challenge for others, but if you collect garbage frequently, then the cabin will stay clean 4) surprisingly good food and beverages: first time in my life I liked airline meal. SweetWater ale is also a big plus. Delta might do a decent job only on the Seattle routs but they do a really great job there.

"Couple Leisure","Economy Class","08-15","no",3,4,1,1,1,2,1," I had a flight from Cancun to Pittsburgh connecting through Atlanta yesterday. On my first flight, a cup of coffee was spilled on my lap after the passenger sitting next to me was bumped by the flight attendant and spilled her coffee. I accept accidents happen and I managed as best I could despite being wet and sticky. I shrugged this off and hurried to immigration/ customs. I have global entry and only had carry-on luggage and saw that there was a 2 hour earlier flight on Delta (15699) that would allow me to get home sooner, out of my sticky clothes and permit me to surprise my 8 year old son by getting to his swim competition in time. From online, it appeared there were over 20 seats open in the main cabin. I stopped at the delta baggage desk right after Customs and asked if this was possible and they said yes but that I had to run up to the gate since it was already boarding. I did just that- I ran! I got myself from the F concourse to the B concourse, Gate 5 and the area was clear, the gate was open for another 5 minutes and was staffed by an agent. I had to rest for 30 seconds just to catch my breath. I explained the agent what the Delta agents had told me to do. His response- was flat and dismissive ""Are you a Delta Platinum member?"" ""Are you A Delta Gold Member?"" I said no to both queries. His next response ""Well then you will have to pay $75 for a ticket change."" I explained that the representatives had indicated this would not be a problem as there were so many seats open- I was already travelling on Delta and normally this flight would not be available to me book as the time between flights is too small to be permitted to book during the initial reservation. I explained how my clothes were now sticky as a result of the coffee being spilled on me. I explained about my 8 year old and wanting to get home. None of this mattered. I was nobody to the agent. My impression after this - Delta only cares about you if you are a Platinum or Gold member. (Ironically I had considered, an hour earlier while in flight, applying for the platinum card as my husband sits on the American Board of Plastic Surgeons and flies often for board meetings. Suffice to say- I will stick with my existing airline credit cards and skip Delta's card as I do not see myself electively travelling on Delta in the future). I begged the agent to call a supervisor - he did but he dawdled and the gate was just 2 minutes from closing. I watched painfully as the door closed and the plane took off and the agent didn't care. There was no empathy, no compassion. Nothing.  I couldn't believe that this Delta agent would let me stand there, bag in hand, knowing he could have been kind and allowed me to see my family earlier, see my son compete and offset my unfortunate 'coffee in the lap' experience. I couldn't believe that he let me sit there knowing how many seats were empty on that flight just to make a point -pay the $75 or wait without reason. The irony is that my scheduled delta flight, 2 hours later, was so full that they had customers waiting in standby. That agent could have freed up my seat if he had let me get on the earlier flight. Poor service all the way around. I will avoid Delta whenever possible.",1.85714285714286,"Trip Verified","ATL","SEA"

But I'm starting to notice that their service is becoming as second rate as other airlines. I was recently flying home on Christmas Eve and was so early to the gate that me and my colleague decided to grab a quick bite very close by. As we sat there and eventually watched other passengers board, we finished our meal and headed back over to the gate. When we got there they informed us they had given our seats away. No intercom, no warning, nothing -- just oversold and a whole bunch of people trying to get to their families in time for Christmas. So they bumped us. The next two flights were also oversold and so we had to buy two new tickets to get home late that night. It took us 9 extra hours to get home and had to fly through Seattle instead of on the direct flight we had seats for. We got to SLC late and many passengers were trying to get to connecting flights. One woman, in particular, had a young sleepy girl and was carrying large bags. She had only a few minutes to get to her gate and was going to miss her flight. We picked up her bags and sprinted no less than a half mile to the other terminal and caught them as they were closing the doors. We told her a woman was coming with her baby and to please hold the flight. It was an honor to get this poor woman and her child on her flight and we saved Delta from her missing her plane on Christmas Eve. That would have been 100% their fault. Now - I just spent 2 hours on the phone hoping Delta would show us a courtsey of some kind of credit for having to spend an extra $750 on new tickets to get home. Their customer service talked over me, did not employ good English, was disrespectful and told me it was all my fault. Even if that's true - why would you not do all you can to save a customer or to take care of a customer who has been so loyal? Why be just like so many other airlines? Delta has become too big and is losing what made them special. I can't believe I'm saying this - but I will choose them last from here on out.

But what frosted my cake was, just this weekend, I signed into Delta to choose my Diamond benefit certificates. They were all closed out. Turns out I was one day late! I wrote Delta, explaining that I had missed their guideline by a day, that it was my fault, and could they help me?

When approaching the attendant at the service counter, the answer was that they have no further information that they could not guarantee the departure time of 6:30 and to take a complementary cookie and be comfortable. Everyone scheduled to be in this flight was treated with disgusting corporate arrogance. As a family traveling with three kids and paying full price for plane ticket.

All in all though, I’ve been impressed with them in recent years. Staff is usually pretty good, seats, entertainment and flight attendants are often exceptional, etc. One complaint, is the economy basic seat assignment algorithms don’t seem to put travelers together initially (hard to verify this, but on a return trip my wife and I were separated on 3 of the 4 legs). Most times it seems like the gate does manage to rearrange seats, but it’s an unnecessary stress/step. It feels like they separate basic economy passengers so (a) they pay to get seats together, or (b) Delta looks good by getting them back together. I guess after traveling for a few decades, I came to expect sitting next to my wife as a basic requirement of service, so the entire extent of any negativity in this review should be attributed to my discontent over the shift away from that strategy. Otherwise, I am fairly impressed with Delta flights.",2.57142857142857,"Trip Verified","Philadelphia","Santiago, Dom Republic"

It still has some serious problems with the overhead bins being tiny; the pilot and flight attendants entreated us 5 or so separate times to NOT put your small backpack and jacket in the bins, but to place them on the ground to make space for roller bags. I should not be punished for packing light and only having a small backpack, and I refuse to put the blazer i will be wearing the following day in an interview on the ground.

We had to take a bus to a remote stand so boarding was somewhat slow and disjointed. That was not announced in advance but became obvious when there was no Delta aircraft at the gate. Once on board, the service was excellent. This was our third international trip on Delta this year and the cabin crews are significantly better than most airlines I have flown recently (with the possible exception of some of the Asian airlines). After take off the crew gave out water bottles and amenity kits then followed that with a welcome on board drink. Then meal service with three options (outlined on the printed menu and flight schedule which had been handed out at the start of the flight). During the flight the flight attendants came through four times offering water or juice and I also saw the flight attendants bring drinks to those who requested them. Snacks were available any time at the back of the plane. A pre-arrival snack with more beverages was offered about an hour before the end of the flight. Just before arrival, the flight attendants came around with farewell candies (in this case mini Toblerone bars) and thanked everyone for flying Delta.

The cabin crew ran rounds with water and soft drinks, and also several rounds with hot drinks and alcohol. The wine is not bad at all. They give hot towels before meals. Food has been improved, too, and the white grape, cheese and toasted almond snack was delish, as was the salted caramel ice cream. The pizza twist served as a second snack was underwhelming, however, but pizza is not my favorite anyway. Nothing to object to cabin crew or pilots, they are up to the task, as they always have been, but the service and the little things that make up the 9 hours on the plane bearable, are much better.
